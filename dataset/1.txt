     NOTE:  This file combines the first two Project Gutenberg\r
     files, both of which were given the filenumber #1. There are\r
     several duplicate files here. There were many updates over\r
     the years.  All of the original files are included in the\r
     "old" subdirectory which may be accessed under the "More\r
     Files" listing in the PG Catalog of this file. No changes\r
     have been made in these original etexts.\r

**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**\r
\r
**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**\r
\r
*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*\r
\r
Below you will find the first nine Project Gutenberg Etexts, in\r
one file, with one header for the entire file.  This is to keep\r
the overhead down, and in response to requests from Gopher site\r
keeper to eliminate as much of the headers as possible.\r
\r
However, for legal and financial reasons, we must request these\r
headers be left at the beginning of each file that is posted in\r
any general user areas, as Project Gutenberg is run mostly by a\r
donation from people like you.\r
\r
If you see our books posted ANYWHERE without these headers, you\r
are requested to send them a note requesting they re-attach the\r
header, otherwise they have no legal protection and we have the\r
loss of the donations we hope will keep Project Gutenberg going\r
long enough to post 10,000 books, plays, musical pieces, etc.\r

\r
\r
The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Declaration of Independence.\r
\r
All of the original Project Gutenberg Etexts from the\r
1970\'s were produced in ALL CAPS, no lower case.  The\r
computers we used then didn\'t have lower case at all.\r
\r
\r
This is a retranscription of one of the first Project\r
Gutenberg Etexts, officially dated December, 1971--\r
and now officially re-released on December 31, 1993--\r
\r
\r
The United States Declaration of Independence was the first Etext\r
released by Project Gutenberg, early in 1971.  The title was stored\r
in an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be\r
hand mounted for retrieval.  The diskpack was the size of a large\r
cake in a cake carrier, cost $1500, and contained 5 megabytes, of\r
which this file took 1-2%.  Two tape backups were kept plus one on\r
paper tape.  The 10,000 files we hope to have online by the end of\r
2001 should take about 1-2% of a comparably priced drive in 2001.\r
\r
This file was never copyrighted, Sharewared, etc., and is thus for\r
all to use and copy in any manner they choose.  Please feel free to\r
make your own edition using this as a base.\r
\r
In my research for creating this transcription of our first Etext,\r
I have come across enough discrepancies [even within that official\r
documentation provided by the United States] to conclude that even\r
"facsimiles" of the Declaration of Indendence will NOT going to be\r
all the same as the original, nor of other "facsimiles."  There is\r
a plethora of variations in capitalization, punctuation, and, even\r
where names appear on the documents [which names I have left out].\r
\r
The resulting document has several misspellings removed from those\r
parchment "facsimiles" I used back in 1971, and which I should not\r
be able to easily find at this time, including "Brittain."\r

\r
\r
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r
\r
\r
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for\r
one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected\r
them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth,\r
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and\r
of Nature\'s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions\r
of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which\r
impel them to the separation.\r
\r
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\r
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\r
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\r
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,\r
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\r
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,\r
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute\r
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing\r
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect\r
their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments\r
long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\r
and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\r
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing\r
the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and\r
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce\r
them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw\r
off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\r
--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now\r
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\r
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated\r
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment\r
of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts\r
be submitted to a candid world.\r
\r
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\r
for the public good.\r
\r
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\r
and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation\r
till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,\r
he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\r
\r
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of\r
large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\r
the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\r
inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\r
\r
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\r
Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them\r
into compliance with his measures.\r
\r
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing\r
with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r
\r
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,\r
to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,\r
incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\r
for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed\r
to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r
\r
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;\r
for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\r
refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,\r
and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\r
\r
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\r
to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\r
\r
He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure\r
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r
\r
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\r
Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\r
\r
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\r
without the Consent of our legislatures.\r
\r
He has affected to render the Military independent of\r
and superior to the Civil Power.\r
\r
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\r
foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\r
giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\r
\r
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r
\r
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\r
which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\r
\r
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\r
\r
For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\r
\r
For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\r
\r
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\r
\r
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\r
Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,\r
and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once\r
an example and fit instrument for introducing the same\r
absolute rule into these Colonies:\r
\r
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,\r
and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\r
\r
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\r
invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r
\r
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\r
and waging War against us.\r
\r
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,\r
and destroyed the lives of our people.\r
\r
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\r
to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\r
with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the\r
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\r
\r
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\r
to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of\r
their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\r
\r
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\r
endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,\r
the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,\r
is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\r
\r
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress\r
in the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered\r
only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked\r
by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\r
of a free People.\r
\r
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.\r
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their\r
legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\r
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\r
settlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice\r
and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\r
common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\r
interrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been\r
deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,\r
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,\r
as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\r
\r
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\r
in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\r
the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\r
and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,\r
solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,\r
and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\r
that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\r
and that all political connection between them and the State\r
of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;\r
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to\r
levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,\r
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\r
of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm\r
reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge\r
to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\r

\r
JFK\'s Inaugural Address, January 20, 1961, 12:11 EST\r
\r
\r
We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. . .\r
symbolizing an end as well as a beginning. . .signifying renewal\r
as well as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God\r
the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century\r
and three-quarters ago.\r
\r
The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands\r
the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.\r
And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought\r
are still at issue around the globe. . .the belief that the rights of man\r
come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\r
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.\r
\r
Let the word go forth from this time and place. . .to friend and foe alike. . .\r
that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans. . .\r
born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace,\r
proud of our ancient heritage. . .and unwilling to witness or permit the slow\r
undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed,\r
and to which we are committed today. . .at home and around the world.\r
\r
Let every nation know. . .whether it wishes us well or ill. . .\r
that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,\r
support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and\r
the success of liberty.  This much we pledge. . .and more.\r
\r
To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:\r
we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is\r
little we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\r
Divided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\r
a powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\r
To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\r
we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\r
have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\r
We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\r
But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\r
own freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\r
foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\r
To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\r
struggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\r
efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\r
is required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,\r
not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\r
If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\r
it cannot save the few who are rich.\r
\r
To our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\r
to convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\r
. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\r
poverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of\r
hostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them\r
to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let\r
every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master\r
of its own house.\r
\r
To that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .\r
our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war\r
have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge\r
of support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for\r
invective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .\r
and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\r
\r
Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,\r
we offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew\r
the quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed\r
by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\r
We dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient\r
beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\r
But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\r
our present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\r
both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\r
to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind\'s\r
final war.\r
\r
So let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\r
is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\r
Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\r
Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\r
those problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,\r
formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\r
control of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\r
other nations under the absolute control of all nations.\r
Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\r
of its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the\r
deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage\r
the arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners\r
of the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to "undo the heavy burdens. . .\r
let the oppressed go free."\r
\r
And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .\r
let both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .\r
but a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .\r
and the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .\r
\r
All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\r
Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .\r
nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps\r
in our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin.\r
\r
In your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the\r
final success or failure of our course.  Since this country was founded,\r
each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony\r
to its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answered\r
the call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .\r
not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\r
though embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\r
twilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\r
patient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\r
tyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against\r
these enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .\r
East and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\r
Will you join in that historic effort?\r
\r
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\r
the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink\r
from this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us\r
would exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\r
The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\r
will light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\r
that fire can truly light the world.\r
\r
And so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can\r
do for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow\r
citizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,\r
but what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.\r
\r
Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\r
ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\r
which we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,\r
with history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\r
the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that\r
here on earth God\'s work must truly be our own.\r

This is a retranscription of one of the first Project\r
Gutenberg Etexts, offically dated December 31, 1974--\r
and now officially re-released on November 19, 1993--\r
130 years after it was spoken.  We will rerelease the\r
Inaugural Address of President Kennedy, officially on\r
November 22, 1993, on the day of the 30th anniversary\r
of his assassination.\r
\r
\r
\r
Lincoln\'s Gettysburg Address, given November 19, 1863\r
on the battlefield near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA\r
\r
\r
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth\r
upon this continent a new nation:  conceived in liberty, and\r
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\r
\r
Now we are engaged in a great civil war. . .testing whether\r
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated. . .\r
can long endure.  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.\r
\r
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place\r
for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.\r
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\r
\r
But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate. . .we cannot consecrate. . .\r
we cannot hallow this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,\r
who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power\r
to add or detract.  The world will little note, nor long remember,\r
what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\r
\r
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished\r
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.\r
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining\r
before us. . .that from these honored dead we take increased devotion\r
to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. . .\r
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. . .\r
that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom. . .\r
and that government of the people. . .by the people. . .for the people. . .\r
shall not perish from this earth.\r

The following edition of The Consitution of the United States of America\r
has been based on many hours of study of a variety of editions, and will\r
include certain variant spellings, punctuation, and captialization as we\r
have been able to reasonable ascertain belonged to the orginal.  In case\r
of internal discrepancies in these matters, most or all have been left.\r
\r
In our orginal editions the letters were all CAPITALS, and we did not do\r
anything about capitalization, consistent or otherwise, nor with most of\r
the punctuation, since we had limited punctionation in those days.\r

\r
Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775.\r
\r
\r
No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities,\r
of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different\r
men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it\r
will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do\r
opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my\r
sentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.\r
The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country.\r
For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of\r
freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject\r
ought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that\r
we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility\r
which we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions\r
at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself\r
as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty\r
toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\r
\r
Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\r
We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\r
song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\r
of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\r
Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\r
and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\r
temporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,\r
I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\r
\r
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of\r
experience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.\r
And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct\r
of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with\r
which  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.\r
Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?\r
Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves\r
to be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our\r
petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and\r
darken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\r
reconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that\r
force must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,\r
sir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to\r
which kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\r
its purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other\r
possible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\r
the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,\r
she has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.\r
They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British\r
ministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?\r
Shall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.\r
Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the\r
subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\r
Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we\r
find which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,\r
deceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert\r
the storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\r
we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have\r
implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and\r
Parliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced\r
additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;\r
and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!\r
In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\r
reconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free--\r
if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which\r
we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\r
struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged\r
ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest\r
shall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!\r
An appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\r
\r
They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\r
an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,\r
or the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\r
guard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength but\r
irresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance\r
by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until\r
our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make\r
a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\r
The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a\r
country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy\r
can send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\r
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will\r
raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the\r
strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,\r
we have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late\r
to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!\r
Our chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!\r
The war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.\r
\r
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\r
but there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\r
from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\r
Our brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\r
What is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,\r
or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\r
Forbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;\r
but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\r

\r
\r
\r
\r
Lincoln\'s Second Inaugural Address\r
March 4, 1865\r
\r
\r
\r
Fellow countrymen:  At this second appearing to take the oath\r
of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended\r
address than there was at the first.  Then a statement, somewhat\r
in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\r
Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\r
have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great\r
contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies\r
of the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress\r
of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known\r
to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory\r
and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction\r
in regard to it is ventured.\r
\r
On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts\r
were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--\r
all sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered\r
from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\r
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--\r
seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\r
Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather\r
than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather\r
than let it perish.  And the war came.\r
\r
One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\r
generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\r
These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\r
that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\r
perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\r
insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\r
no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\r
\r
Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\r
which it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\r
of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\r
should cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\r
fundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\r
to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\r
It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God\'s\r
assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men\'s faces;\r
but let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both\r
could not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.\r
\r
The Almighty has his own purposes.  "Woe unto the world because\r
of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe\r
to that man by whom the offense cometh."  If we shall suppose\r
that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the\r
providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\r
through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\r
gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due\r
to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any\r
departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a\r
living God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently\r
do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\r
Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\r
the bondsman\'s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil\r
shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash\r
shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\r
three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "The\r
judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."\r
\r
With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\r
the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\r
to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation\'s wounds;\r
to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\r
and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\r
and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\r

\r
\r
Lincoln\'s First Inaugural Address\r
March 4, 1861\r
\r
\r
\r
Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\r
as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\r
and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\r
of the United States, to be taken by the President "before he enters\r
on the execution of his office."\r
\r
I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters\r
of administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.\r
\r
Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States\r
that by the accession of a Republican administration their property\r
and their peace and personal security are to be endangered.\r
There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.\r
Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while\r
existed and been open to their inspection.  It is found in\r
nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\r
I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\r
"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\r
the institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have\r
no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."\r
Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\r
that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\r
never recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\r
platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\r
the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\r
\r
"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\r
of the rights of the States, and especially\r
the right of each State to order and control\r
its own domestic institutions according to\r
its own judgment exclusively, is essential\r
to that balance of power on which the perfection\r
and endurance of our political fabric depend,\r
and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\r
force of the soil of any State or Territory,\r
no matter under what pretext,\r
as among the gravest of crimes."\r
\r
I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\r
the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\r
is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\r
are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\r
I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\r
Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\r
to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\r
as cheerfully to one section as to another.\r
\r
There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\r
from service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\r
written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\r
\r
"No person held to service or labor in one State,\r
under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\r
shall in consequence of any law or regulation\r
therein be discharged from such service or labor,\r
but shall be delivered up on claim of the party\r
to whom such service or labor may be due."\r
\r
It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\r
who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\r
and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\r
of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\r
to this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\r
then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\r
"shall be delivered up", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\r
would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\r
equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\r
that unanimous oath?\r
\r
There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\r
be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\r
difference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\r
surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\r
by which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\r
content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\r
controversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\r
\r
Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\r
liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\r
so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\r
And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\r
enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\r
"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and\r
immunities of citizens in the several States?"\r
\r
I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\r
and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\r
any hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\r
particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\r
that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\r
to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\r
than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\r
them held to be unConstitutional.\r
\r
It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r
under our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\r
and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\r
the executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\r
many perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\r
of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\r
term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\r
the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r
\r
I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\r
the Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\r
if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\r
It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\r
in its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\r
the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\r
endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\r
not provided for in the instrument itself.\r
\r
Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\r
of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\r
be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r
One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\r
but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?\r
\r
Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition\r
that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\r
the history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\r
the Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\r
Association in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\r
Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\r
and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\r
and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\r
in 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\r
and establishing the Constitution was "TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION."\r
\r
But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\r
be lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\r
having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r
\r
It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\r
can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\r
to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\r
within any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\r
are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\r
\r
I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\r
the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\r
as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\r
laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\r
Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\r
and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\r
rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\r
requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\r
I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r
declared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\r
defend and maintain itself.\r
\r
In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\r
shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\r
The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\r
the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\r
the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\r
there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\r
anywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\r
shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\r
from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\r
obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\r
legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\r
these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\r
and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\r
to forego for the time the uses of such offices.\r
\r
The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r
of the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\r
sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\r
and reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r
events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r
and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\r
according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\r
a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\r
restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\r
\r
That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\r
the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\r
neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\r
to them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r
\r
Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\r
national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\r
would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\r
Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\r
that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\r
Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\r
the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\r
fearful a mistake?\r
\r
All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\r
can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\r
in the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\r
mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\r
Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision\r
of the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a\r
majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,\r
it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such\r
a right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of\r
minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\r
and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\r
controversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be\r
framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may\r
occur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,\r
nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions\r
for all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered\r
by national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.\r
May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not\r
expressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?\r
The Constitution does not expressly say.\r
\r
From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\r
and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\r
will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\r
There is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\r
acquiescence on one side or the other.\r
\r
If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\r
they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\r
for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\r
a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.\r
For instance, why may not any portion of a new\r
confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\r
precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\r
All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\r
exact temper of doing this.\r
\r
Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States\r
to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\r
and prevent renewed secession?\r
\r
Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\r
A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\r
and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\r
opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\r
Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\r
Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\r
is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\r
anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\r
\r
I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\r
questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny\r
that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties\r
to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled\r
to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\r
departments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that\r
such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\r
following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that\r
it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\r
can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.\r
At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy\r
of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,\r
is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\r
the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties\r
in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,\r
having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands\r
of that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon\r
the court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink\r
to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of\r
theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\r
\r
One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought\r
to be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought\r
not to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.\r
The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the\r
suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,\r
perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral\r
sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.\r
The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\r
in both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,\r
cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\r
AFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign\r
slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\r
without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\r
now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\r
at all by the other.\r
\r
Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\r
respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r
between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of\r
the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different\r
parts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain\r
face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,\r
must continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make\r
that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\r
separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than\r
friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\r
between aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,\r
you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\r
an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\r
as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.\r
\r
This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.\r
Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise\r
their CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right\r
to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact\r
that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the\r
national Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of\r
amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\r
over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed\r
in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,\r
favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people\r
to act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode\r
seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with\r
the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or\r
reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen\r
for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\r
wish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment\r
to the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has\r
passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall\r
never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\r
including that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction\r
of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\r
amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be\r
implied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express\r
and irrevocable.\r
\r
The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,\r
and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the\r
separation of the states.  The people themselves can do this\r
also if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to\r
do with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,\r
as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,\r
to his successor.\r
\r
Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice\r
of the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?\r
In our present differences is either party without faith of being\r
in the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal\r
truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours\r
of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,\r
by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.\r
\r
By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\r
have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\r
and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little\r
to their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain\r
their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of\r
wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government\r
in the short space of four years.\r
\r
My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this\r
whole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.\r
If there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step\r
which you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be\r
frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated\r
by it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the\r
old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\r
the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration\r
will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.\r
If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\r
right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason\r
for precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,\r
and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,\r
are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\r
\r
In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,\r
is the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.\r
You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\r
YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_\r
shall have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend it."\r
\r
I am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not\r
be enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break\r
our bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from\r
every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone\r
all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union\r
when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\r

The United States Declaration of Independence was the first Etext\r
released by Project Gutenberg, early in 1971.  The title was stored\r
in an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be\r
hand mounted for retrieval.  The diskpack was the size of a large\r
cake in a cake carrier, cost $1500, and contained 5 megabytes, of\r
which this file took 1-2%.  Two tape backups were kept plus one on\r
paper tape.  The 10,000 files we hope to have online by the end of\r
2001 should take about 1-2% of a comparably priced drive in 2001.\r
\r
This file was never copyrighted, Sharewared, etc., and is thus for\r
all to use and copy in any manner they choose.  Please feel free to\r
make your own edition using this as a base.\r
\r
In my research for creating this transcription of our first Etext,\r
I have come across enough discrepancies [even within that official\r
documentation provided by the United States] to conclude that even\r
"facsimiles" of the Declaration of Indendence will NOT going to be\r
all the same as the original, nor of other "facsimiles."  There is\r
a plethora of variations in capitalization, punctuation, and, even\r
where names appear on the documents [which names I have left out].\r
\r
The resulting document has several misspellings removed from those\r
parchment "facsimiles" I used back in 1971, and which I should not\r
be able to easily find at this time, including "Brittain."\r

The Declaration of Independence of The United States of America\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776\r
\r
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America\r
\r
\r
\r
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for\r
one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected\r
them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth,\r
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and\r
of Nature\'s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions\r
of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which\r
impel them to the separation.\r
\r
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\r
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\r
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\r
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,\r
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\r
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,\r
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute\r
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing\r
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect\r
their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments\r
long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\r
and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\r
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing\r
the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and\r
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce\r
them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw\r
off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\r
--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now\r
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\r
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated\r
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment\r
of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts\r
be submitted to a candid world.\r
\r
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\r
for the public good.\r
\r
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\r
and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation\r
till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,\r
he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\r
\r
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of\r
large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\r
the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\r
inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\r
\r
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\r
Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them\r
into compliance with his measures.\r
\r
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing\r
with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r
\r
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,\r
to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,\r
incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\r
for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed\r
to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r
\r
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;\r
for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\r
refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,\r
and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\r
\r
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\r
to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\r
\r
He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure\r
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r
\r
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\r
Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\r
\r
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\r
without the Consent of our legislatures.\r
\r
He has affected to render the Military independent of\r
and superior to the Civil Power.\r
\r
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\r
foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\r
giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\r
\r
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r
\r
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\r
which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\r
\r
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\r
\r
For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\r
\r
For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\r
\r
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\r
\r
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\r
Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,\r
and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once\r
an example and fit instrument for introducing the same\r
absolute rule into these Colonies:\r
\r
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,\r
and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\r
\r
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\r
invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r
\r
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\r
and waging War against us.\r
\r
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,\r
and destroyed the lives of our people.\r
\r
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\r
to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\r
with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the\r
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\r
\r
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\r
to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of\r
their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\r
\r
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\r
endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,\r
the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,\r
is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\r
\r
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress\r
in the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered\r
only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked\r
by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\r
of a free People.\r
\r
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren.\r
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their\r
legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\r
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\r
settlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice\r
and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\r
common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\r
interrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been\r
deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,\r
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,\r
as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\r
\r
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\r
in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\r
the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\r
and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,\r
solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,\r
and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\r
that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\r
and that all political connection between them and the State\r
of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;\r
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to\r
levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,\r
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\r
of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm\r
reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge\r
to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\r

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\r
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\r
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not\r
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r
\r
We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance\r
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\r
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,\r
even years after the official publication date.\r

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\r
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\r
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\r
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\r
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\r
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\r
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\r
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\r
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\r
If they reach just 1-2% of the world\'s population then the total\r
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year\'s end.\r
\r
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\r
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\r
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\r

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS\r
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,\r
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart\r
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").\r
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright\r
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and\r
distribute it in the United States without permission and\r
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth\r
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook\r
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.\r
\r
Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market\r
any commercial products without permission.\r
\r
To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable\r
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain\r
works. Despite these efforts, the Project\'s eBooks and any\r
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other\r
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or\r
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\r
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged\r
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer\r
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.\r
\r

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of\r
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)\r
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that\r
time to the person you received it from. If you received it\r

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement\r
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may\r
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to\r
receive it electronically.\r
