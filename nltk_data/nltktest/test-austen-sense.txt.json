{"Input":"but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her","Output":"sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment."}
{"Input":"to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,","Output":"and THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away"}
{"Input":"received warmth from one, or discerning objects through","Output":"the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,"}
{"Input":"spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck","Output":"her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion"}
{"Input":"she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.","Output":"But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,"}
{"Input":"and worse than both.  Knowing all this, as I have now","Output":"known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing"}

{"Input":"and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger","Output":"of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister,"}

{"Input":"and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.","Output":"\"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH"}

{"Input":"Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he","Output":"had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still"}
{"Input":"was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined","Output":"very early in the seizure that Marianne would never"}
{"Input":"be quick--and if you can--less violent.\"","Output":"\"Sit down, and I will be both.\""}
{"Input":"at this assertion.","Output":"Lucy went on.  \"I am rather of a jealous temper too"}
{"Input":"It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind","Output":"of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with"}

{"Input":"the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,","Output":"a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness."}
{"Input":"and at last she determined to send for Edward.","Output":"He came.  But I am sorry to relate what ensued."}
{"Input":"could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.","Output":"The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself"}
{"Input":"and after listening half a minute, returned into the room","Output":"in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard"}
{"Input":"settled that the invitation should be fully accepted.","Output":"Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great"}

{"Input":"\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it","Output":"be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you"}
{"Input":"They were again silent for many minutes.  At length","Output":"Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,"}

{"Input":"\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him,","Output":"on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,"}

{"Input":"grounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness which first","Output":"made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,"}
{"Input":"of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton","Output":"Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them"}
{"Input":"found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings","Output":"was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry with her"}
{"Input":"with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty","Output":"miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;"}
{"Input":"\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would,","Output":"he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased"}

{"Input":"even to formality, in her figure, and serious,","Output":"even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her complexion was sallow;"}
{"Input":"every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I am","Output":"talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,"}
{"Input":"it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,","Output":"and how he was received, need not be particularly told."}
{"Input":"walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely","Output":"coming to visit them."}
{"Input":"\"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come","Output":"I hope...I am sure you will like him.\""}
{"Input":"and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,","Output":"her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret"}
{"Input":"promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.","Output":"Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how"}
{"Input":"treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband","Output":"with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody"}
{"Input":"in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity","Output":"which they had no means of lessening but by their"}

{"Input":"to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,","Output":"to reflect on her own with discontent."}
{"Input":"without the smallest surprise or distrust.  She saw with","Output":"maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments"}

{"Input":"But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should","Output":"be in town today?\""}

{"Input":"\"Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort,","Output":"their friendliness in every particular, is more than I"}

{"Input":"\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.","Output":"\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings"}

{"Input":"for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon.","Output":"He will have her at last; aye, that he will.  Mind me,"}

{"Input":"I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient","Output":"to those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,"}
{"Input":"but which had not the assistance of any encouragement","Output":"from her companions.  Marianne, not contented with"}
{"Input":"abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither","Output":"reasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people"}
{"Input":"ladies were obliged to yield.","Output":"\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they"}
{"Input":"I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough","Output":"in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,"}
{"Input":"which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks","Output":"longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible"}

{"Input":"Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.","Output":"She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the"}

{"Input":"John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature","Output":"was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished"}

{"Input":"and in all probability with severity.  In another day","Output":"or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last"}
{"Input":"\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not","Output":"have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your"}

{"Input":"But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account","Output":"of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her,"}
{"Input":"and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted","Output":"with him at all.  She wished with all her heart Combe"}
{"Input":"never to see her again.\"","Output":"\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor,"}
{"Input":"attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--","Output":"and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy"}
{"Input":"up and hurried out of the room.","Output":"\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone,"}
{"Input":"by the farther knowledge of her character, which half","Output":"a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps"}
{"Input":"arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;","Output":"to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat"}

{"Input":"Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.","Output":"Comparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,"}
{"Input":"He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;","Output":"and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection"}
{"Input":"not seen him before since his engagement became public,","Output":"and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted"}
{"Input":"about it when she is present; and the less that may ever","Output":"be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings"}

{"Input":"consideration of their age, characters, or feelings,","Output":"could be given;--but her mother must always be carried"}
{"Input":"\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am","Output":"sure you must have heard of her before.  She is a relation"}
{"Input":"sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was","Output":"persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would"}
{"Input":"and talked of the weather.","Output":"Marianne had retreated as much as possible"}
{"Input":"and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her","Output":"readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness"}
{"Input":"But while the imaginations of other people will carry","Output":"them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,"}
{"Input":"John Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for the first","Output":"time these two months--he spoke to me.--That he had cut"}
{"Input":"sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,","Output":"for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,"}
{"Input":"was interesting.  His name was good, his residence was in","Output":"their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all"}
{"Input":"walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived","Output":"so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed"}
{"Input":"was due to her which might make her at all less so.","Output":"She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness"}
{"Input":"for the last time to Willoughby.","Output":"Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention"}
{"Input":"and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen","Output":"every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,"}
{"Input":"tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining","Output":"of ankles.\""}
{"Input":"This desponding turn of mind, though it could not","Output":"be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain"}
{"Input":"\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth","Output":"has much to do with it.\""}
{"Input":"would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their","Output":"falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every"}
{"Input":"on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly","Output":"interesting to them all.  As this silence continued,"}
{"Input":"her first reply was not very auspicious.","Output":"\"Cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation."}
{"Input":"of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the","Output":"number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than"}
{"Input":"and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive","Output":"how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am"}
{"Input":"\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,","Output":"\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\""}
{"Input":"\"that Willoughby were among us again.\"","Output":"This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions"}
{"Input":"to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.","Output":"I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind"}
{"Input":"and ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,","Output":"as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;"}
{"Input":"would like to associate with.  But now I can carry her","Output":"a most satisfactory account of both.\""}
{"Input":"\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always","Output":"the way with him!  Sometimes he won't speak to me for half"}
{"Input":"No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected","Output":"by Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again"}
{"Input":"\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"","Output":"\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought"}
{"Input":"up their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,","Output":"and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,"}
{"Input":"Marianne's feelings did not stop here.  The cold","Output":"insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister,"}
{"Input":"The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;","Output":"and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy"}
{"Input":"was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,","Output":"were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart."}
{"Input":"were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.","Output":"To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long"}
{"Input":"Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.","Output":"She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion"}
{"Input":"\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,","Output":"\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\""}
{"Input":"Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,","Output":"and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door."}
{"Input":"but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.","Output":"Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he feigned"}
{"Input":"portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,","Output":"she was not without a settled habitation of her own."}
{"Input":"young women in her life, as she was with them; had given","Output":"each of them a needle book made by some emigrant;"}
{"Input":"for her children, the most rapacious of human beings,","Output":"is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;"}
{"Input":"A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave","Output":"Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;"}
{"Input":"or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased","Output":"with him.  He is not a young man with whom one can"}
{"Input":"to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her","Output":"sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the"}
{"Input":"and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection.","Output":"Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had"}
{"Input":"unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.","Output":"\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\"","Output":"said Mrs. Jennings.  \"What is the gentleman's name?\""}
{"Input":"with which everything had been carried on between them,","Output":"was rationally treated as enormously heightening"}
{"Input":"these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing","Output":"intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford"}

{"Input":"that I believe his character to be in other respects","Output":"irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return"}
{"Input":"it required no other consideration of probabilities","Output":"to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;"}
{"Input":"and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance","Output":"which her husband's wanted.  But they would have been"}
{"Input":"sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with","Output":"which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always"}
{"Input":"therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with","Output":"unexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably"}
{"Input":"which was followed before the end of the day by a present","Output":"of game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their"}
{"Input":"She was not immediately able to say anything, and even","Output":"when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short"}
{"Input":"by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother,","Output":"rather than her own, whom they were about to behold;"}
{"Input":"While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.","Output":"Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he"}
{"Input":"wise enough to be contented with the house as it was;","Output":"and each of them was busy in arranging their particular"}
{"Input":"between them occurred.","Output":"\"At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet"}

{"Input":"but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,","Output":"had she known how little offence it had given her sister."}
{"Input":"parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which","Output":"so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,"}
{"Input":"\"Certainly, ma'am,\" replied Elinor, not hearing","Output":"much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,"}
{"Input":"months to produce any good to me.\"","Output":"This desponding turn of mind, though it could not"}
{"Input":"John observed with great contentment.  Willoughby took","Output":"his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods."}

{"Input":"The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was","Output":"lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied."}

{"Input":"grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation","Output":"to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their"}
{"Input":"Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;","Output":"and your brother, he walked about the room, and said"}
{"Input":"ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"","Output":"\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood."}
{"Input":"she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked","Output":"of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,"}
{"Input":"to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person","Output":"so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence."}
{"Input":"regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.","Output":"Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother"}

{"Input":"We consulted together, however, as to what should be done,","Output":"and at last she determined to send for Edward."}

{"Input":"\"Whom do you mean, ma'am?\" said he, colouring a little.","Output":"\"Oh! you know who I mean.\""}
{"Input":"anticipations of both were almost done away; for when","Output":"Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better."}
