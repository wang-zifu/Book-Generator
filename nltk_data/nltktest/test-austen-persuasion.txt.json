{"Input":"Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back","Output":"had been completely in the old English style, containing only"}

{"Input":"\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.","Output":"Every minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off"}
{"Input":"She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;","Output":"but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous"}
{"Input":"Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.","Output":"It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,"}
{"Input":"at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,","Output":"there is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,"}
{"Input":"believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman","Output":"than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply"}

{"Input":"Mr Elliot's good fortune.\"","Output":"\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next."}
{"Input":"and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this","Output":"superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\""}
{"Input":"He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.","Output":"She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,"}
{"Input":"My line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently","Output":"a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had"}

{"Input":"blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features","Output":"which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement"}
{"Input":"(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),","Output":"and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself"}
{"Input":"from Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,","Output":"when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as"}
{"Input":"Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.","Output":"The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then"}
{"Input":"by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;","Output":"nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it"}
{"Input":"of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be","Output":"benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers."}
{"Input":"my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,","Output":"and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!"}
{"Input":"for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,","Output":"the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,"}
{"Input":"Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth","Output":"was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before."}
{"Input":"grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,","Output":"in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,"}

{"Input":"thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor","Output":"in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville"}
{"Input":"of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,","Output":"if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,"}
{"Input":"for all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt","Output":"as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.","Output":"Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking."}
{"Input":"Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.","Output":"Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal"}
{"Input":"as implying less.  He must love her.","Output":"These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if","Output":"making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the"}
{"Input":"of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,","Output":"certainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,"}
{"Input":"(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,","Output":"careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think"}
{"Input":"From that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner","Output":"been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days"}
{"Input":"not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded","Output":"for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's"}
{"Input":"As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said","Output":"which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:"}
{"Input":"in cultivation and manners to all the rest.","Output":"The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride"}
{"Input":"had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick","Output":"had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of"}

{"Input":"when they saw him coming after them, with three companions,","Output":"all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable","Output":"that they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind"}
{"Input":"that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove","Output":"should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection"}
{"Input":"I should like to know why you imagine I am?\"","Output":"Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,"}
{"Input":"Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,'","Output":"to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\""}

{"Input":"and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her","Output":"from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,"}
{"Input":"By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew","Output":"near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,"}
{"Input":"the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint","Output":"being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on"}
{"Input":"upon your time.\"","Output":"Anne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and"}
{"Input":"She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;","Output":"and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,"}
{"Input":"her eyes devoured the following words:","Output":"\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means"}
{"Input":"of one personal grace!","Output":"At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she"}
{"Input":"arranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed","Output":"of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,"}
{"Input":"determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.","Output":"She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk"}
{"Input":"fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;","Output":"actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed"}
{"Input":"It had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been","Output":"weakness and timidity."}
{"Input":"not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they","Output":"were nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,"}
{"Input":"Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;","Output":"but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days"}
{"Input":"and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,","Output":"under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation"}
{"Input":"sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.","Output":"Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they"}
{"Input":"and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without","Output":"a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter"}
{"Input":"This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties,","Output":"and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath"}

{"Input":"and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which","Output":"he had lost his wife."}

{"Input":"have received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have","Output":"the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;"}
{"Input":"\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.","Output":"I am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature"}
{"Input":"\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we","Output":"to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand."}
{"Input":"the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,","Output":"the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired,"}
{"Input":"for going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,","Output":"and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was felt"}
{"Input":"Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much","Output":"in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed"}
{"Input":"As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared","Output":"for whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\""}

{"Input":"to persuade a person to anything!  I am afraid of her, as I have","Output":"told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;"}
{"Input":"like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight","Output":"my father's acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed"}
{"Input":"to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,","Output":"as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,","Output":"or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were"}
{"Input":"Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,","Output":"for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming longer"}
{"Input":"and decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously","Output":"well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,"}
{"Input":"You will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"","Output":"\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville"}

{"Input":"Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds","Output":"were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open"}
{"Input":"I am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have","Output":"all been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been"}
{"Input":"The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride","Output":"on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness"}

{"Input":"she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone","Output":"who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed"}

{"Input":"\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,","Output":"has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could"}
{"Input":"A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,","Output":"why should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;"}
{"Input":"Pity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.","Output":"In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,"}
{"Input":"though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her's","Output":"and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much"}
{"Input":"Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing","Output":"that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful."}
{"Input":"though it had been an appointment.","Output":"An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections"}
{"Input":"on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay","Output":"in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation"}
{"Input":"whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention","Output":"is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father's heir:  the future"}

{"Input":"that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.","Output":"By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,"}
{"Input":"\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,","Output":"before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity"}
{"Input":"in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that","Output":"her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy"}
{"Input":"as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between","Output":"them had ceased."}
{"Input":"with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,","Output":"agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how"}
{"Input":"almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,","Output":"in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell."}
{"Input":"in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all","Output":"the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,"}
{"Input":"there is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,","Output":"be differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,"}
{"Input":"with the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,","Output":"I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,"}

{"Input":"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom","Output":"might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;"}
{"Input":"a little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck","Output":"and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;"}
{"Input":"is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure","Output":"you will agree with me.\""}
{"Input":"for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of","Output":"fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess."}
{"Input":"we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance","Output":"she might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;"}
{"Input":"\"I did.\"","Output":"\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\""}
{"Input":"to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth","Output":"very much in the way."}
{"Input":"and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,","Output":"and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure."}
{"Input":"in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,","Output":"after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him"}
{"Input":"could hint of caution and reserve.","Output":"Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,"}
{"Input":"in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.","Output":"His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour"}
{"Input":"should come in.","Output":"They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,"}
{"Input":"in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs","Output":"which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity"}
{"Input":"confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,","Output":"was rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,"}
{"Input":"\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"","Output":"\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,"}
{"Input":"I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.","Output":"I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit"}
{"Input":"It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him","Output":"and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out"}
{"Input":"to the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,","Output":"I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir."}
{"Input":"You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything","Output":"is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you."}
{"Input":"Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,","Output":"instead of going to Bath."}
{"Input":"Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt","Output":"the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell."}
{"Input":"or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable","Output":"prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,"}
{"Input":"and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look","Output":"as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"\"Intimately.\"","Output":"\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life."}
{"Input":"and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only","Output":"which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints"}
{"Input":"in the world.  The folly of the means they often employ","Output":"is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\""}
{"Input":"very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,","Output":"as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal"}
{"Input":"the door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,","Output":"but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room"}
{"Input":"began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,","Output":"and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled."}
{"Input":"The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.","Output":"It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been"}
{"Input":"and Mr Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been","Output":"a single preliminary difference to modify of all that"}
{"Input":"occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by","Output":"those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked"}

{"Input":"Here was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman","Output":"with a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it"}

{"Input":"Captain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it","Output":"than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him"}
{"Input":"\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,","Output":"and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured"}

{"Input":"\"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,","Output":"in her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,"}
{"Input":"done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,","Output":"and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity"}
{"Input":"\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.","Output":"She is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time"}
{"Input":"than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be","Output":"so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may"}

{"Input":"looking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt","Output":"these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope"}
{"Input":"with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage","Output":"in the volume of honour."}
{"Input":"\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"","Output":"\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;"}
{"Input":"Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,","Output":"and pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself"}
{"Input":"and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;","Output":"and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell"}
{"Input":"attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.","Output":"\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again"}
{"Input":"Never worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,","Output":"I think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,"}
{"Input":"\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from","Output":"a little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not"}
{"Input":"\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.","Output":"We were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always"}

{"Input":"And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,","Output":"Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in."}
{"Input":"present state with proper interest.","Output":"The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,"}
{"Input":"seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced","Output":"into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.","Output":"You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night."}
{"Input":"this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving","Output":"a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought"}
{"Input":"Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt","Output":"not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined"}
{"Input":"In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;","Output":"and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters'"}
{"Input":"who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,","Output":"was just such another.  Between these two, she could want"}
{"Input":"He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,","Output":"though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having"}
{"Input":"we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised","Output":"not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited"}
{"Input":"more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,","Output":"sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because"}
{"Input":"Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for","Output":"the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,"}
{"Input":"and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,","Output":"and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced"}
{"Input":"I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.","Output":"We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in"}
{"Input":"however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,","Output":"his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action"}
{"Input":"getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;","Output":"but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,"}
{"Input":"and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,","Output":"more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\""}
{"Input":"that the few alterations we have made have been all very much","Output":"for the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however."}
{"Input":"Chapter 10","Output":"Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur."}
{"Input":"She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all","Output":"the high-priced things I have in hand now.\""}
{"Input":"And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you","Output":"to go about the house or not.\""}
{"Input":"so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father","Output":"so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure"}
{"Input":"but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.","Output":"She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all"}
{"Input":"and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,","Output":"quite as soon as Louisa's.  \"And a very good living it was,\""}
{"Input":"A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture","Output":"in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton"}
{"Input":"was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.","Output":"\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot"}
{"Input":"even than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned","Output":"to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,"}
{"Input":"with Benwick.","Output":"\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least"}
{"Input":"than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;","Output":"had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,"}

{"Input":"\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints","Output":"you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,"}
{"Input":"is not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,","Output":"truly!\""}
{"Input":"How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,","Output":"were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful"}

{"Input":"ought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"","Output":"Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance"}
{"Input":"\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,","Output":"and I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,"}
{"Input":"after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,","Output":"or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town,"}
{"Input":"to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,","Output":"in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy"}
{"Input":"I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense","Output":"to understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be"}
{"Input":"there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;","Output":"and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing"}
{"Input":"brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries","Output":"in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground."}
{"Input":"which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view","Output":"of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side."}
{"Input":"more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"","Output":"\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,"}
{"Input":"\"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a quivering lip he wound up","Output":"the whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\""}
{"Input":"He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with","Output":"more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one."}
{"Input":"with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.","Output":"They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter","Output":"to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment"}
{"Input":"which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,","Output":"but as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given"}
{"Input":"nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered","Output":"almost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think"}
{"Input":"into making her the wife of Sir William.","Output":"It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked"}
{"Input":"of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant","Output":"and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing"}
{"Input":"before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off","Output":"on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel"}
{"Input":"Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?","Output":"You will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\""}
{"Input":"Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,","Output":"disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;"}
{"Input":"no wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought","Output":"to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven"}
{"Input":"that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,","Output":"could hint of caution and reserve."}
{"Input":"so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth","Output":"under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest"}
{"Input":"their degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,","Output":"but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while"}
{"Input":"\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,","Output":"well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;"}
{"Input":"compared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,","Output":"been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,"}
{"Input":"and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort","Output":"of No.--, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples"}

{"Input":"collected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted","Output":"the solitude and silence which only numbers could give."}
{"Input":"\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,","Output":"to turn her eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!"}
{"Input":"somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him","Output":"to breakfast at his father's."}
{"Input":"if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner","Output":"on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\""}
{"Input":"and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking","Output":"to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,"}
{"Input":"to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be","Output":"the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment."}
{"Input":"at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer","Output":"supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was"}
{"Input":"towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;","Output":"and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful"}
{"Input":"very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.","Output":"It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,"}
{"Input":"for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne","Output":"have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,"}
{"Input":"At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  \"Now, how would she","Output":"speak of him?\""}
{"Input":"so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,","Output":"and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent"}
{"Input":"nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right","Output":"to stay in Henrietta's stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?"}
{"Input":"\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"","Output":"\"I did.\""}
{"Input":"there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.","Output":"From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been"}

{"Input":"He must love somebody.","Output":"She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine"}
{"Input":"might have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.","Output":"I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn"}
{"Input":"of Uppercross.\"","Output":"Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having"}
{"Input":"I knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,","Output":"or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days"}

{"Input":"circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which","Output":"he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,"}

{"Input":"that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;","Output":"and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her."}
{"Input":"than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself","Output":"and went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end"}
{"Input":"could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now","Output":"no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think"}
{"Input":"With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,","Output":"she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely"}
{"Input":"if he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends","Output":"as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist"}

{"Input":"She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.","Output":"All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects"}
{"Input":"Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than","Output":"Anne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet"}

{"Input":"\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.","Output":"We have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter"}
{"Input":"the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable","Output":"of success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,"}
{"Input":"during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects","Output":"to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,"}
{"Input":"of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore","Output":"an object of first-rate importance."}

{"Input":"a weak spot anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,","Output":"\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,"}
{"Input":"prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,","Output":"that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\""}
{"Input":"half hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings","Output":"are gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart"}
{"Input":"what you did.\"","Output":"Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"placed in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits","Output":"against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and"}
{"Input":"but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry","Output":"but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon"}

{"Input":"was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,","Output":"the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit","Output":"from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,"}
{"Input":"had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,","Output":"and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things"}
{"Input":"taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which","Output":"had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to"}

{"Input":"be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's,","Output":"to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling"}
{"Input":"constant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,","Output":"he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles"}
{"Input":"disclosed all, too late?","Output":"It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;"}
{"Input":"They had met.  They had been once more in the same room.","Output":"Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less."}
{"Input":"in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose","Output":"he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,"}
{"Input":"imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,","Output":"she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,"}
{"Input":"Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,","Output":"and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into"}
{"Input":"a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house","Output":"when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her."}
{"Input":"and in a calmer manner, she added,","Output":"\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman."}
{"Input":"All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects","Output":"of strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,"}
{"Input":"when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--","Output":"\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match."}
{"Input":"we say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from","Output":"outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,"}
{"Input":"There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits","Output":"had nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,"}
{"Input":"and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne","Output":"had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing"}
{"Input":"whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation","Output":"of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him"}
{"Input":"had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life","Output":"(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,"}
{"Input":"you know, the West Indies.\"","Output":"Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself"}
{"Input":"no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his","Output":"making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,"}
{"Input":"but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,","Output":"nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer"}
{"Input":"I could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where","Output":"dear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;"}
{"Input":"and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away","Output":"in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing"}
{"Input":"not romancing so much as you supposed.\"","Output":"\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do."}
{"Input":"\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.","Output":"He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,"}
{"Input":"with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.","Output":"I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,"}
{"Input":"would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,","Output":"and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which"}

{"Input":"be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence","Output":"in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,"}
{"Input":"at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other","Output":"ill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\""}
{"Input":"who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,","Output":"(Sir Basil Morley).  `Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin."}
{"Input":"He staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-","Output":"piece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman"}
{"Input":"it would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.","Output":"It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,"}
{"Input":"he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,","Output":"with a little smile, a little glow, he said--"}
{"Input":"or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give","Output":"delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed."}
{"Input":"that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,","Output":"and then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!'"}
{"Input":"or what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.","Output":"She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,"}
{"Input":"and Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears","Output":"all day long."}
{"Input":"the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,","Output":"made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification."}
{"Input":"and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,","Output":"but \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she"}
{"Input":"I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.","Output":"She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening"}
{"Input":"and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong","Output":"an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description"}
{"Input":"for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose","Output":"strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,","Output":"and she continued--"}
{"Input":"the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,","Output":"skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,"}
{"Input":"I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability","Output":"of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger"}
{"Input":"\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.","Output":"But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him."}
{"Input":"Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant","Output":"to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther."}
{"Input":"had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot","Output":"died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which","Output":"shewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,"}
{"Input":"to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all","Output":"the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?"}
{"Input":"will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing","Output":"Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,"}
{"Input":"in general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister","Output":"in the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children"}
{"Input":"the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying,","Output":"in a tone of great exultation--"}
{"Input":"bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise","Output":"of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;"}
{"Input":"be differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,","Output":"now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart"}
{"Input":"in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained","Output":"the words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them."}
{"Input":"and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings","Output":"in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken."}
{"Input":"should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection","Output":"of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those"}
{"Input":"more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when","Output":"it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed"}
{"Input":"I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though","Output":"I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,"}
{"Input":"as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?","Output":"This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,"}
{"Input":"\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are","Output":"to have next,\" turning to the bill."}
{"Input":"taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck","Output":"in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate"}
{"Input":"\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,","Output":"was all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather"}
{"Input":"if it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants","Output":"take care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive"}
{"Input":"an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and","Output":"all the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough"}
{"Input":"I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much","Output":"of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,"}
{"Input":"\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement","Output":"to another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,"}
{"Input":"without display; he judged for himself in everything essential,","Output":"without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum."}
{"Input":"with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,","Output":"had made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath"}
{"Input":"can hardly have much truth left.\"","Output":"\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of"}
{"Input":"quite long enough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always","Output":"give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there,"}
{"Input":"you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement","Output":"happened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an introduction.","Output":"I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate."}
{"Input":"and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having","Output":"a carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were"}
{"Input":"Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming","Output":"Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness"}
{"Input":"The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,","Output":"was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction"}
{"Input":"could bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings","Output":"and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,"}
{"Input":"he had lost his wife.","Output":"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,"}
{"Input":"what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity","Output":"which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being"}
{"Input":"Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.","Output":"He persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted."}
{"Input":"as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist","Output":"in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis"}
{"Input":"Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.","Output":"He must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished"}
{"Input":"Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings","Output":"eight years may be little more than nothing."}
{"Input":"fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report","Output":"but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however."}
{"Input":"was just such another.  Between these two, she could want","Output":"no possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said"}
{"Input":"Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,","Output":"but the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up"}
{"Input":"and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"","Output":"\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,"}
{"Input":"and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--","Output":"\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot"}
{"Input":"the place he held in society.  He considered the blessing of beauty","Output":"as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,"}
{"Input":"in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.","Output":"She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,"}
{"Input":"They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,","Output":"which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur"}
{"Input":"to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,","Output":"and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred"}
{"Input":"She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of","Output":"Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,"}
{"Input":"of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,","Output":"can hardly have much truth left.\""}
{"Input":"\"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately","Output":"drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced"}
{"Input":"attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;","Output":"with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and"}
{"Input":"that it was very evident they would not have more than time","Output":"for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone."}
{"Input":"to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only","Output":"been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been"}
{"Input":"with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were","Output":"talking the matter over."}
{"Input":"Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"","Output":"\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,"}
{"Input":"but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson","Output":"felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words"}
{"Input":"she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description","Output":"to heave."}
{"Input":"had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,","Output":"against previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest"}
{"Input":"`happy.'  There was no promise.\"","Output":"\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail."}
{"Input":"In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of","Output":"being released from him; some one was taking him from her,"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.","Output":"I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of"}
{"Input":"The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were","Output":"to be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself."}
{"Input":"when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as","Output":"the probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,"}
{"Input":"Queen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--","Output":"\"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away"}
{"Input":"you know, are always worse than anybody's.\"","Output":"So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,"}
{"Input":"the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.","Output":"Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could"}
{"Input":"I am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.","Output":"I shall be at your service in half a minute.\""}
{"Input":"that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment","Output":"which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone."}
{"Input":"\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours","Output":"at the Great House?\""}
{"Input":"you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabby fellows,","Output":"both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way."}
{"Input":"\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.","Output":"In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,"}
{"Input":"either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell","Output":"fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,"}
{"Input":"whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's retrenching,","Output":"and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without"}
{"Input":"They are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,","Output":"in general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister"}
{"Input":"and there must be intercourse between the two families.","Output":"This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time"}
{"Input":"connected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!","Output":"we shall certainly take that post.\""}
{"Input":"comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more","Output":"of your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\""}
{"Input":"She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.","Output":"Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances."}
{"Input":"the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,","Output":"and riding out the heaviest weather.\""}
{"Input":"Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her","Output":"being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters"}
{"Input":"of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been","Output":"for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that"}
{"Input":"In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.","Output":"Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject,"}
{"Input":"sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes","Output":"and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had"}
{"Input":"however, Louisa spoke again.","Output":"\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;"}

{"Input":"and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"","Output":"After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about"}
{"Input":"and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains","Output":"to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,"}
{"Input":"\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.","Output":"Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?"}
{"Input":"\"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late","Output":"if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands."}
{"Input":"all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!","Output":"An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these,"}

{"Input":"there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,","Output":"than to half a reformation.  Her knowledge of her father"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.","Output":"He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open"}
{"Input":"quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.","Output":"She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,"}
{"Input":"They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had","Output":"most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove."}

{"Input":"were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,","Output":"and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent"}
{"Input":"Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness","Output":"of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage"}
{"Input":"They would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all","Output":"beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction,"}
{"Input":"on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view","Output":"the greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,"}
{"Input":"Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him","Output":"in his cousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him"}
{"Input":"\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,","Output":"and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue"}
{"Input":"receiving her in that house, there was particular attention.","Output":"The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,"}
{"Input":"Anne was at liberty.","Output":"In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples","Output":"in books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story."}
{"Input":"four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter","Output":"had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions"}
{"Input":"as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was","Output":"chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised"}
{"Input":"A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things","Output":"should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,"}
{"Input":"some of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.","Output":"I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen"}
{"Input":"This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,","Output":"and decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously"}
{"Input":"and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in","Output":"any other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company"}

{"Input":"stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of","Output":"going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box"}
{"Input":"Anne looked down to hide her smile.","Output":"\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has"}
{"Input":"How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?","Output":"Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open."}
{"Input":"in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm","Output":"of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased"}
{"Input":"Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.  The party drove off in very good spirits;","Output":"Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted"}
{"Input":"\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,","Output":"and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening."}
{"Input":"You remember him, I am sure.\"","Output":"\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford."}
{"Input":"when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,","Output":"and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,"}
{"Input":"he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,","Output":"and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme."}
{"Input":"and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville","Output":"had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,"}
{"Input":"of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,","Output":"in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;"}

{"Input":"reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude","Output":"never appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought"}
{"Input":"to be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect","Output":"that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,"}
{"Input":"you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,","Output":"the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been"}
{"Input":"in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy","Output":"to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been"}
{"Input":"Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all","Output":"fairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening"}
{"Input":"and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see","Output":"in only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority,"}
{"Input":"or men of any other description, can have had such a range;","Output":"but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,"}
{"Input":"that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat","Output":"of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,"}
{"Input":"as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.","Output":"She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,"}
{"Input":"as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening","Output":"the interference in any plan of their own."}
{"Input":"delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman","Output":"in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;"}
{"Input":"as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;","Output":"but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!"}
