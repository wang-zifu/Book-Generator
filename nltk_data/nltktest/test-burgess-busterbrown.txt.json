{"Input":"where Buster Bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that\r","Output":"way. Then he hid near by, where he could watch. Buster was late that\r"}
{"Input":"to be sure. He was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his\r","Output":"mouth. Buster Bear's own mouth watered as he saw it. Little Joe sat down\r"}

{"Input":"\"You got no more than you deserve for stealing Farmer Brown's boy's\r","Output":"berries,\" said Sammy Jay, who had come back and was looking on from the\r"}

{"Input":"It isn't very often that Chatterer the Red Squirrel knows fear. That is\r","Output":"one reason that he is so often impudent and saucy. But once in a while a\r"}
{"Input":"A few doubted Little Joe's story. One of them was Blacky the Crow.\r","Output":"Another was Reddy Fox. Blacky doubted because he knew Farmer Brown's boy\r"}
{"Input":"But it was of no use. The sharp eyes of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow\r","Output":"saw him. They actually flew into the very tree under which he was\r"}
{"Input":"no! He just chomped them all up together and patted his stomach from\r","Output":"sheer delight. Now Buster had reached the Old Pasture just as jolly,\r"}

{"Input":"far-away ground.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"for he deliberately ate them. He knew well enough that some one must\r","Output":"have picked them--for whoever heard of blueberries growing in tin pails?\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Boaster! Boaster!\" cried Peter Rabbit.\r"}
{"Input":"Blacky didn't know what to make of it. He screamed harder and louder\r","Output":"than ever, until his voice grew so hoarse he couldn't scream any more,\r"}
{"Input":"don't know about. Buster Bear _had_ come to live in the Green Forest,\r","Output":"and Farmer Brown's boy _had_ seen his footprint. But Farmer Brown\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"If I whistle,\" thought he, \"everybody will know just where I am, and\r"}

{"Input":"that Farmer Brown's boy wasn't afraid of anybody or anything, and as\r","Output":"most of them were very much afraid of him, they had hard work to believe\r"}
{"Input":"At least, Little Joe did.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Now I guess Farmer Brown's boy will keep away from the Green Forest,\r"}
{"Input":"could have all I could eat. Um-m-m-m! Makes my mouth water just to think\r","Output":"of it. There ought to be some up in the Old Pasture. There ought to be a\r"}
{"Input":"That is what Farmer Brown's boy did when he met Buster Bear, and a lot\r","Output":"of the little people of the Green Forest and some from the Green Meadows\r"}
{"Input":"\"I believe,\" said Little Joe as he wiped tears of laughter from his\r","Output":"eyes, \"that Grandfather Frog is right, and that the best thing I can do\r"}
{"Input":"Then he jumped on the helpless pail. With a blow of a big paw he sent it\r","Output":"clattering against a tree. He tried to bite it. Then he once more fell\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Everybody leaned forward to watch him. \"What did I tell you? Didn't I\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"But this little pool, instead of being beautiful and clear so that\r"}

{"Input":"Now all around, behind trees and stumps, and under thick branches, and\r","Output":"even in tree tops, were other little people watching with round,\r"}
{"Input":"Little Joe went off down to the Smiling Pool in a great rage.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"Joe put the fish back on the log and waited. This time he didn't take\r","Output":"his eyes off it. At last, when he was almost ready to give up, he saw\r"}
{"Input":"Green Forest, he kept right on to the deepest, darkest, most lonesome\r","Output":"part and crept under the thickest hemlock-tree he could find.\r"}
{"Input":"Isn't it funny how two people will often think of the same thing at the\r","Output":"same time, and neither one know that the other is thinking of it? That\r"}
{"Input":"greatness of Buster Bear.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"face; and while it was true that Farmer Brown's boy had run away as fast\r","Output":"as ever he could, it was also true that Buster Bear had done the same\r"}
{"Input":"good! But it takes more than three trout to fill Buster Bear's stomach,\r","Output":"so he kept on to the next little pool.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"[Illustration: Buster Bear was running away, too. Page _71_.]\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go up to the Old Pasture this\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"There the same thing happened. He was very patient, very, very patient,\r"}
{"Input":"always it is of mischief. He is one of the smartest and cleverest of all\r","Output":"the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and all the\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"But Farmer Brown's boy didn't know anything about Old Man Coyote. He\r"}
{"Input":"So now they were very proud to think that one of their own number\r","Output":"actually had frightened him, and they began to look on Buster Bear as a\r"}

{"Input":"hard as ever he could, Sammy Jay flying just behind him and screaming,\r","Output":"\"Thief, thief, thief!\" at the top of his lungs, and behind him Blacky\r"}
{"Input":"But most of all he listened to a merry, low, silvery laugh that never\r","Output":"stopped but went on and on, until he just felt as if he must laugh too.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Thief, thief, thief!\" screamed Sammy until his throat was sore. The\r"}
{"Input":"little eyes saw that pailful, he forgot everything but the feast that\r","Output":"was waiting for him right under his very nose. He didn't think anything\r"}
{"Input":"out loud, for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the\r","Output":"sandwiches should have been, and they were not there. No, Sir, there\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"That's a splendid idea!\" cried Little Joe Otter. \"We'll do it right\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"He was turning it all over in his mind and studying what it could mean,\r"}
{"Input":"all things he most wanted to do, for big as he is and strong as he is,\r","Output":"Buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around. He growled\r"}

{"Input":"Now all this time the other little people of the Green Forest and the\r","Output":"Green Meadows had been hiding where they could see all that went on.\r"}
{"Input":"It never had happened before. You see, there isn't much of anything that\r","Output":"Farmer Brown's boy is really afraid of. Perhaps he wouldn't have been\r"}

{"Input":"he would go home to the Green Forest.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"light-hearted when he goes fishing. You see, he is just as fond of\r","Output":"fishing as is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink or Buster Bear. And now he\r"}
{"Input":"laughed at the smartness of Buster.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"mind.\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"XVII\r"}
{"Input":"caught no fish. This puzzled him more than ever. It didn't seem possible\r","Output":"that such a little fellow as Billy Mink could have caught or frightened\r"}
