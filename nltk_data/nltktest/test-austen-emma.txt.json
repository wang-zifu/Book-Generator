{"Input":"and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted","Output":"for nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,"}

{"Input":"and are come to give us joy.  This does not seem much like joy,","Output":"indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be"}
{"Input":"grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly","Output":"impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style"}
{"Input":"Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,","Output":"in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--"}

{"Input":"\"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children","Output":"a great deal of good.\""}
{"Input":"for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.","Output":"Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her."}

{"Input":"This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;","Output":"and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,"}

{"Input":"none which they suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough,","Output":"handsome enough.  It would hold the very number for comfort."}

{"Input":"you admire her except her complexion.\"","Output":"He shook his head and laughed.--\"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax"}
{"Input":"With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;","Output":"but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling"}

{"Input":"not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,","Output":"\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.  What a pity it"}
{"Input":"so disappointed.\"  And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge","Output":"her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--"}
{"Input":"\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.  But poor Mrs. Bates","Output":"had a bad cold about a month ago.\""}

{"Input":"the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed","Output":"exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,"}
{"Input":"at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.","Output":"Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,"}

{"Input":"Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--","Output":"I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,"}

{"Input":"Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must","Output":"have some weight.  He gave her to understand that Frank admired"}

{"Input":"which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,","Output":"and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with."}

{"Input":"She had previously determined how far she would proceed,","Output":"on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,"}
{"Input":"Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly","Output":"new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it"}

{"Input":"\"Good God!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--","Output":"most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\""}
{"Input":"Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,","Output":"and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable"}

{"Input":"had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder","Output":"that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers."}
{"Input":"Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;","Output":"and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at"}
{"Input":"and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received","Output":"every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's"}
{"Input":"that it did not take her wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave","Output":"me hints of it.  I remember her telling me at the ball, that I"}

{"Input":"\"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\"","Output":"\"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.  There will be"}
{"Input":"and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,","Output":"as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had"}
{"Input":"very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.","Output":"\"Oh! no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence."}
{"Input":"and she was herself struck by his warmth.  With a faint blush,","Output":"she presently replied,"}
{"Input":"\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella","Output":"in the plaintive tone which just suited her father."}
{"Input":"of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.","Output":"Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering"}
{"Input":"The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's","Output":"that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,"}
{"Input":"\"He was generally thought so.\"  \"Did he appear a sensible young man;","Output":"a young man of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common"}
{"Input":"comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;","Output":"for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every","Output":"wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane"}
{"Input":"immediately to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended","Output":"to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise"}
{"Input":"says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;","Output":"and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands"}
{"Input":"for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter,","Output":"is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,"}
{"Input":"get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;","Output":"but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a","Output":"very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille."}
{"Input":"incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.  She opened","Output":"the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,"}
{"Input":"as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.","Output":"\"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said."}
{"Input":"He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing","Output":"for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith."}
{"Input":"\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,","Output":"sir.  Something new for your coachman and horses to be making"}
{"Input":"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys","Output":"being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their"}
{"Input":"Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.  It was the end","Output":"of an old pencil,--the part without any lead."}
{"Input":"\"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--","Output":"\"is not this the oddest news that ever was?\""}
{"Input":"a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.","Output":"\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand,"}
{"Input":"to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,","Output":"he would make a good husband.  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry."}
{"Input":"I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such","Output":"elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--"}
{"Input":"approbation while he writes with such gallantry.\"","Output":"\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating"}
{"Input":"feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite","Output":"another subject,"}
{"Input":"Churchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--","Output":"looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without"}
{"Input":"This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.","Output":"It inspired little more than an animating curiosity."}
{"Input":"minutes silence, he said,","Output":"\"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton"}
{"Input":"for her friend and herself.","Output":"Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young"}
{"Input":"when we dress the leg it will be another thing.  Good morning to you,","Output":"my dear sir.  Oh!  Mr. Knightley is coming too.  Well, that is"}
{"Input":"and a very agreeable evening we had.  Such kind friends, you know,","Output":"Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body"}
{"Input":"She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of","Output":"their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill."}
{"Input":"drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--","Output":"How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--"}
{"Input":"the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.","Output":"Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question."}
{"Input":"It was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love","Output":"without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,"}
{"Input":"answer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement","Output":"that could be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\""}
{"Input":"such words.  Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as","Output":"a pretty young woman.\""}
{"Input":"to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,","Output":"which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,"}
{"Input":"take care of _them_.\"","Output":"Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,"}
{"Input":"But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,","Output":"and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come"}
{"Input":"as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now","Output":"upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were"}
{"Input":"Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking","Output":"inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,"}
{"Input":"and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.","Output":"Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting"}
{"Input":"as well as she could; but it was all confusion.  She had taken","Output":"up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it."}
{"Input":"But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him","Output":"over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination"}
{"Input":"a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.  I mention no names;","Output":"but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\""}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he","Output":"had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,"}
{"Input":"had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,","Output":"and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  Mrs. Weston"}
{"Input":"for my friend.  She will probably have soon done, and then we","Output":"shall go home.  But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear"}
{"Input":"more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things","Output":"I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently"}
{"Input":"She pondered, but could think of nothing.  After a mutual silence","Output":"of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--"}
{"Input":"a pretty young woman.\"","Output":"\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it,"}
{"Input":"than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected","Output":"to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they"}
{"Input":"never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--","Output":"The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,"}
{"Input":"was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather","Output":"appearing exactly right."}
{"Input":"independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.  I want to see you","Output":"permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable"}
{"Input":"He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little","Output":"doubt and very little mercy.  Soon afterwards he began again,"}
{"Input":"have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\"","Output":"\"Emma!\" cried he, looking eagerly at her, \"are you, indeed?\"--"}
{"Input":"be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles","Output":"to a young man?--An hour's ride.  He would be always coming over."}
{"Input":"\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were","Output":"all in the street."}
{"Input":"But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom","Output":"from home.\""}
{"Input":"is very different from almost all the rest.  We are so very airy!","Output":"I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--"}
{"Input":"\"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed","Output":"to blame herself.  `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state"}
{"Input":"known that you are a superior performer.\"","Output":"\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea."}
{"Input":"to this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought to hear.","Output":"I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,"}
{"Input":"to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating","Output":"me upon it!  It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,"}
{"Input":"I think?\"","Output":"Emma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests"}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young","Output":"man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew"}
{"Input":"songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;","Output":"and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct"}
{"Input":"\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for","Output":"more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;"}
{"Input":"certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.\"","Output":"Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,"}
{"Input":"My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.\"","Output":"Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,"}
{"Input":"be lessened by his marriage.  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--","Output":"many awkwardnesses smoothed by it.  A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for"}
{"Input":"an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.","Output":"All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form"}
{"Input":"nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,","Output":"and could accompany her own voice well.  One accompaniment to her song"}
{"Input":"to spend a few days with John and Isabella.  Have you any thing to","Output":"send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?\""}
{"Input":"and others of the son and the uncle not letting him.  All manner","Output":"of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none"}
{"Input":"which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient","Output":"for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough"}
{"Input":"it had never entered my head.  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with","Output":"her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.\""}
{"Input":"my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\"","Output":"\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which"}
{"Input":"they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,","Output":"on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies."}
{"Input":"by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the","Output":"very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at"}
{"Input":"She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted","Output":"no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--"}
{"Input":"to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury","Output":"of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions"}
{"Input":"Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.","Output":"Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--"}
{"Input":"They have no mercy on her.\"","Output":"Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even"}
{"Input":"by observing audibly to her partner,","Output":"\"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,"}
{"Input":"by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,","Output":"with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side"}
{"Input":"modern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,","Output":"I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.  Oh!  I assure"}
{"Input":"They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \"Men's Beavers\"","Output":"and \"York Tan\" were bringing down and displaying on the counter,"}
{"Input":"said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.","Output":"His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,"}
{"Input":"as well as Surry.\"","Output":"\"No, I fancy not,\" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\""}
{"Input":"and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.","Output":"He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be"}
{"Input":"to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.","Output":"He had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--"}
{"Input":"It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let","Output":"her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be"}
{"Input":"very. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him","Output":"before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any"}
{"Input":"will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,","Output":"I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,"}
{"Input":"marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;","Output":"but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing"}
{"Input":"them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.\"","Output":"Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was"}
{"Input":"and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to","Output":"her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of"}
{"Input":"and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--","Output":"such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,"}
{"Input":"this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--","Output":"I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I"}
{"Input":"the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.","Output":"He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,"}
{"Input":"comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills","Output":"were also in town; and they were only waiting for November."}
{"Input":"she was then conveyed to Hartfield.","Output":"There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,"}
{"Input":"gone only four weeks.\"","Output":"Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,"}
{"Input":"as ever.","Output":"It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could"}

{"Input":"is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--","Output":"Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than"}
{"Input":"by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person","Output":"or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar,"}
{"Input":"many awkwardnesses smoothed by it.  A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for","Output":"any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark."}
