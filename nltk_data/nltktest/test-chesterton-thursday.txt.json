{"Input":"Syme, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor,","Output":"got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation."}
{"Input":"cockney contempt. This combination at once tickled and terrified","Output":"the nerves of a neurotic population. He seemed like a walking"}

{"Input":"once into the chauffeur's seat, and with flushed face was wrenching","Output":"and tugging at the disused machinery. He bent his strength upon one"}
{"Input":"But he was smiling and altogether at ease. He had made up his mind,","Output":"and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white"}

{"Input":"Still Sunday said nothing, but only sat with his mighty chin upon","Output":"his hand, and gazed at the distance. Then at last he said--"}

{"Input":"Gregory's big bull's eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry","Output":"lion, and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose."}

{"Input":"\"Yes,\" said Syme, \"I have a secret.\" Then after a pause, \"Will you","Output":"swear?\""}
{"Input":"In the presence of the President the whole company looked","Output":"sufficiently commonplace; nothing about them caught the eye at"}
{"Input":"he was the Devil! Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had a","Output":"human sword been driven into him and made no mark. When Syme had"}
{"Input":"with a pencil. It was arranged like a printed catechism, with","Output":"questions and answers, and was delivered with an extraordinary"}

{"Input":"When Syme stepped out on to the steam-tug he had a singular","Output":"sensation of stepping out into something entirely new; not merely"}
{"Input":"each other. The Secretary had to tell Syme how they had come to","Output":"wear masks originally in order to approach the supposed enemy as"}
{"Input":"the elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long","Output":"stretch of the streets. This time Sunday did not turn round, but"}
{"Input":"them. Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the","Output":"ease and hospitality of their new surroundings, this man's eyes"}
{"Input":"\"Oh, bring me some lobster mayonnaise.\"","Output":"To his indescribable astonishment, the man only said \"Certainly,"}

{"Input":"He says that if only a certain obstacle be removed--say a wealthy","Output":"uncle--he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise"}
{"Input":"\"A good evening is it?\" he said sharply. \"You fellows would call","Output":"the end of the world a good evening. Look at that bloody red sun"}
{"Input":"the end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their","Output":"story. They turned and faced the town."}
{"Input":"\"I gather that you fully understand your position,\" said Sunday.","Output":"\"You bet,\" answered the Pole. \"I see it's a fair cop. All I say is,"}

{"Input":"out of my mouth quite different. You should hear me say, 'Buck up,","Output":"old cock!' It would bring tears to your eyes.\""}
{"Input":"when Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red","Output":"subterranean light, Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown"}

{"Input":"Ratcliffe. In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful, he broke","Output":"the bottomless silence and made conversation."}
{"Input":"began to shake, and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady.","Output":"It shook like a loathsome and living jelly. It reminded me of"}
{"Input":"small streets were sloppy and full of pools, which reflected the","Output":"flaming lamps irregularly, and by accident, like fragments of some"}
{"Input":"hundred eyes. Syme had never seen any of the sky-scraping buildings","Output":"in America, so he could only think of the buildings in a dream."}
{"Input":"factory chimney, and the two, with their chairs and table, shot","Output":"down through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them. They"}
{"Input":"in the hour without hope.\"","Output":"There was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the"}

{"Input":"He leant his angular elbow far across the table, and put up his","Output":"large loose hand like a flap to his ear."}

{"Input":"in a grey check coat, in broad daylight. He talked to me in an","Output":"ordinary way. But I'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about"}
{"Input":"Syme also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a","Output":"walking-stick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick,"}

{"Input":"Syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this","Output":"dehumanized brotherhood; but even he could not believe that the"}
{"Input":"brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo.","Output":"Or am I too fanciful? Was he really following me? Surely Sunday"}
{"Input":"Thus it was that when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson","Output":"light of evening, in his shabby black hat and shabby, lawless"}
{"Input":"Without further parley, he led the way through several by-ways","Output":"until they came out into the flare and clamour of the East India"}
{"Input":"carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing","Output":"ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now. Originally,"}
{"Input":"\"Comrades,\" cried Gregory, in a voice like that of a martyr who in","Output":"an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain, \"it is nothing to me"}
{"Input":"\"I mean that we shall never get there,\" said the pessimist","Output":"placidly. \"They have two rows of armed men across the road already;"}
{"Input":"As if to destroy the last hope or doubt, the Colonel, who saw him","Output":"coming, pointed his revolver at him and fired. The shot missed"}

{"Input":"And universal darkness buries all.\"'","Output":"\"Stop!\" cried Bull suddenly, \"the gendarmes are out.\""}

{"Input":"for that place they will reach. It is because after they have","Output":"passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be"}
{"Input":"suppose, why this square itself should look so alien and in some","Output":"ways so continental. It will never be known whether it was the"}
{"Input":"others instinctively followed him. Syme seemed a little distrait,","Output":"and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick"}
{"Input":"black and ragged; and the combination gave him the look of the","Output":"early villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton. Also his yellow beard"}
{"Input":"had peeped out at him almost pruriently, and given him a sense of","Output":"drawing nearer and nearer to the head-quarters of hell. And this"}
{"Input":"first considerable hurt.","Output":"Dr. Bull, however, having been carefully coached by Syme upon this"}
{"Input":"his thick beard. By the sheer rush of routine, however, the motion","Output":"would have been put and carried. But as the chairman was opening"}
{"Input":"across the room in snaky twists, went straight up as if from a","Output":"factory chimney, and the two, with their chairs and table, shot"}

{"Input":"On one side of this lawn, alive with dancers, was a sort of green","Output":"bank, like the terrace in such old-fashioned gardens."}

{"Input":"the nursery rhymes, \"the crooked man who went a crooked mile.\" He","Output":"really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the"}

{"Input":"so lurid, that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the","Output":"sunset it mirrored. It looked like a stream of literal fire winding"}
{"Input":"An instant after Syme thought his own eyes had gone mad in his","Output":"head. For the philanthropic Dr. Renard had deliberately raised his"}
