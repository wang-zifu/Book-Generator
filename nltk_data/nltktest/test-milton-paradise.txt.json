{"Input":" ","Output":"  "}
{"Input":"With Spirits masculine, create at last ","Output":"This novelty on earth, this fair defect "}
{"Input":"Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked: ","Output":"The cattle in the fields and meadows green: "}

{"Input":"Their aery caravan, high over seas ","Output":"Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing "}
{"Input":"Impossible is held; as argument ","Output":"Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out, "}
{"Input":"Whose foul idolatries, and other faults ","Output":"Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense "}
{"Input":"With borders long the rivers: that Earth now ","Output":"Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, "}
{"Input":"But still I see the tenour of Man's woe ","Output":"Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. "}
{"Input":"He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep. ","Output":"Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope "}
{"Input":"Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears ","Output":"Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air "}

{"Input":"With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed, ","Output":"Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft, "}
{"Input":"All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all. ","Output":"That day, as other solemn days, they spent "}
{"Input":"By falsities and lies the greatest part ","Output":"Of mankind they corrupted to forsake "}
{"Input":"Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared, ","Output":"Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, "}

{"Input":"Amber, and colours of the showery arch. ","Output":"He, in celestial panoply all armed "}
{"Input":"Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised, ","Output":"They open to themselves at length the way "}
{"Input":"Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount. ","Output":"Creation and the six days acts they sung: "}
{"Input":"Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed, ","Output":"Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized "}
{"Input":"But if within the circuit of these walks, ","Output":"In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom "}
{"Input":"The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, ","Output":"And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. "}
{"Input":"Benevolent and facile thus replied. ","Output":"To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven "}
{"Input":"Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven ","Output":"To their own vile advantages shall turn "}
{"Input":"Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread ","Output":"Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! "}
{"Input":"That led th' embattled Seraphim to war ","Output":"Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds "}
{"Input":"Those two; the third best absent is condemned, ","Output":"Convict by flight, and rebel to all law: "}
{"Input":"Of each tree in the garden we may eat; ","Output":"But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"In prospect; there the eagle and the stork ","Output":"On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build: "}
{"Input":"And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed. ","Output":"To whom thus Adam fervently replied. "}
{"Input":"Thy empire!  Easily the proud attempt ","Output":"Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain, "}
{"Input":"Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale ","Output":"The battle hung; till Satan, who that day "}
{"Input":"His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern ","Output":"Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down "}
{"Input":"Bending to look on me:  I started back, ","Output":"It started back; but pleased I soon returned, "}
{"Input":"Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own; ","Output":"Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced; "}
{"Input":"Now had the Almighty Father from above, ","Output":"From the pure empyrean where he sits "}
{"Input":"Marrying or prostituting, as befel, ","Output":"Rape or adultery, where passing fair "}
{"Input":"His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope ","Output":"To be invulnerable in those bright arms, "}
{"Input":"To re-salute the world with sacred light, ","Output":"Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed "}
{"Input":"The middle tree and highest there that grew, ","Output":"Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life "}
{"Input":"Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added ","Output":"The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable "}
{"Input":"The misery; I deserved it, and would bear ","Output":"My own deservings; but this will not serve: "}
{"Input":"With man therein or beast; but, when he brings ","Output":"Over the earth a cloud, will therein set "}
{"Input":"To us invisible, or dimly seen ","Output":"In these thy lowest works; yet these declare "}
{"Input":"Unterrified, and like a comet burned, ","Output":"That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge "}
{"Input":"Rising in clouded majesty, at length ","Output":"Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light, "}
{"Input":"By merit more than birthright Son of God, ","Output":"Found worthiest to be so by being good, "}
{"Input":"Appeared, and serried shields in thick array ","Output":"Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move "}
{"Input":"Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep ","Output":"Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate, "}
{"Input":"Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon ","Output":"Who after came from earth, failing arrived "}
{"Input":"Deterred not from achieving what might lead ","Output":"To happier life, knowledge of good and evil; "}
{"Input":"Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain ","Output":"Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew "}
{"Input":"The rigid satisfaction, death for death. ","Output":"Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love? "}
{"Input":"So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: ","Output":"And on the east side of the garden place, "}
{"Input":"Him God beholding from his prospect high, ","Output":"Wherein past, present, future, he beholds, "}
{"Input":"A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed ","Output":"For dignity composed, and high exploit. "}
{"Input":"So strictly, but much more to pity inclined, ","Output":"He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife "}
{"Input":"That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force; ","Output":"And force upon free will hath here no place. "}
{"Input":"Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep, ","Output":"A gentle wafting to immortal life. "}
{"Input":"Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives, ","Output":"Fomented by his virtual power and warmed: "}
{"Input":"Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers ","Output":"From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold; "}
{"Input":"To Satan only like both crime and doom. ","Output":"O Conscience! into what abyss of fears "}
{"Input":"And head! what thou hast said is just and right. ","Output":"For we to him indeed all praises owe, "}
{"Input":"The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat ","Output":"In reason, and is judicious; is the scale "}
{"Input":"Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, ","Output":"Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched "}
{"Input":"Not tried or manacled with joint or limb, ","Output":"Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, "}
{"Input":"Within his sanctuary itself their shrines, ","Output":"Abominations; and with cursed things "}
{"Input":"Sleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close ","Output":"Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree "}
{"Input":"Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings ","Output":"Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale "}
{"Input":"Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old ","Output":"In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof; "}
{"Input":"Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds ","Output":"The silent hours, and the other whose gay train "}
{"Input":"He made not lord; such title to himself ","Output":"Reserving, human left from human free. "}
{"Input":"Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow ","Output":"All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; "}
{"Input":"He brought thee into this delicious grove, ","Output":"This garden, planted with the trees of God, "}
{"Input":"And country, whereof here needs no account; ","Output":"But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, "}
{"Input":"Our heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford ","Output":"Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow "}
{"Input":"Against his better knowledge; not deceived, ","Output":"But fondly overcome with female charm. "}
{"Input":"But cloud instead, and ever-during dark ","Output":"Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men "}
{"Input":"Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed. ","Output":"If this be our condition, thus to dwell "}
{"Input":"His proud imaginations thus displayed:-- ","Output":"  \"Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!-- "}
{"Input":"Successive; and the timely dew of sleep, ","Output":"Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines "}
{"Input":"I must return to native dust?  O sight ","Output":"Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, "}
{"Input":"To vital spirits aspire, to animal, ","Output":"To intellectual; give both life and sense, "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Sufficient to subdue us to his will, ","Output":"But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems, "}
{"Input":"And at our pleasant labour, to reform ","Output":"Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green, "}
{"Input":"We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground ","Output":"Covered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here "}
{"Input":"I come no enemy, but to set free ","Output":"From out this dark and dismal house of pain "}
{"Input":"One foot he centered, and the other turned ","Output":"Round through the vast profundity obscure; "}
{"Input":"And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall ","Output":"Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting, "}
{"Input":"Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live. ","Output":"For such vast room in Nature unpossessed "}
{"Input":"Won from the void and formless infinite. ","Output":"Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, "}
{"Input":"Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled. ","Output":"Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes, "}
{"Input":"A dismal universal hiss, the sound ","Output":"Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long "}
{"Input":"'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: ","Output":"'But of the tree whose operation brings "}
{"Input":"Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold, ","Output":"Will save us trial what the least can do "}
{"Input":"Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl ","Output":"So well converse, nor with the ox the ape; "}
{"Input":"High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men, ","Output":"Sad task and hard:  For how shall I relate "}
{"Input":"O Friends! why come not on these victors proud ","Output":"Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we, "}
{"Input":"Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills. ","Output":"This ponder, that all nations of the earth "}
{"Input":"And mortal food; as may dispose him best ","Output":"For dissolution wrought by sin, that first "}
{"Input":"And with obsequious majesty approved ","Output":"My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower "}
{"Input":"But in his way lights on the barren plains ","Output":"Of Sericana, where Chineses drive "}
{"Input":"Black fire and horror shot with equal rage ","Output":"Among his Angels, and his throne itself "}
{"Input":"Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn, ","Output":"I know not whence possessed thee; we had then "}
{"Input":"Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve ","Output":"In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, "}
{"Input":"With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies; ","Output":"And ye five other wandering Fires, that move "}
{"Input":"Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill ","Output":"Where no ill seems:  Which now for once beguiled "}
{"Input":"Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute, ","Output":"Consent or custom, and his regal state "}
{"Input":"Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame ","Output":"Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced "}
{"Input":"Risen from a river o'er the marish glides, ","Output":"And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel "}
{"Input":"Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued ","Output":"With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds "}
{"Input":"Mother of all things living, since by thee ","Output":"Man is to live; and all things live for Man. "}
{"Input":"With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed. ","Output":"Myself I then perused, and limb by limb "}
{"Input":"But ever to do ill our sole delight, ","Output":"As being the contrary to his high will "}
{"Input":"In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven; ","Output":"And they, who to be sure of Paradise, "}
{"Input":"Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood, ","Output":"Both turned, and under open sky adored "}
{"Input":"Than that which by creation first brought forth ","Output":"Light out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand, "}
{"Input":"Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! ","Output":"A bevy of fair women, richly gay "}
{"Input":"To answer, and resound far other song.-- ","Output":"Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, "}
{"Input":"Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light: ","Output":"The second time returning, in his bill "}
{"Input":"Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words ","Output":"Touched only; that our trial, when least sought, "}
{"Input":"His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, ","Output":"Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile "}
{"Input":"My only strength and stay:  Forlorn of thee, ","Output":"Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? "}
{"Input":"Pour forth their populous youth about the hive ","Output":"In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers "}
{"Input":"'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires; ","Output":"Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear "}
{"Input":" By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room ","Output":"The head of all mankind, though Adam's son. "}
{"Input":"Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise ","Output":"Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither "}
{"Input":"And should I at your harmless innocence ","Output":"Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just, "}
{"Input":"Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged ","Output":"Vapours not yet into her substance turned. "}
{"Input":"Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower, ","Output":"If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet, "}
{"Input":"Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile; ","Output":"So numberless were those bad Angels seen "}
{"Input":"Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief. ","Output":"I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice "}
{"Input":"Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood, ","Output":"With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift, "}
{"Input":"Seduce them to our party, that their God ","Output":"May prove their foe, and with repenting hand "}
{"Input":"Thou usest, and from thence createst more good. ","Output":"Witness this new-made world, another Heaven "}
{"Input":"Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite ","Output":"Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue "}
{"Input":"To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease ","Output":"More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite "}
{"Input":"Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled, ","Output":"Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey "}
{"Input":"With admiration and deep muse, to hear ","Output":"Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought "}
{"Input":"Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins ","Output":"His other half in the great zone of Heaven. "}
{"Input":"An ark, and in the ark his testimony, ","Output":"The records of his covenant; over these "}
{"Input":"Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood, ","Output":"Which from his darksome passage now appears, "}
{"Input":"Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived ","Output":"In Eden; distance inexpressible "}
{"Input":"Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, ","Output":"Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy "}
{"Input":"Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even ","Output":"On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star "}
{"Input":"Enough is left besides to search and know. ","Output":"But knowledge is as food, and needs no less "}
{"Input":"Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes ","Output":"Of commonalty:  Swarming next appeared "}
{"Input":"At the sad sentence rigorously urged, ","Output":"(For I behold them softened, and with tears "}
{"Input":"Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores, ","Output":"Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon "}

{"Input":"Fled ignominious, to such evil brought ","Output":"By sin of disobedience; till that hour "}
{"Input":"Immediate are the acts of God, more swift ","Output":"Than time or motion, but to human ears "}
{"Input":"Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery ","Output":"Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument "}
{"Input":"Wherever thus created, for no place ","Output":"Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest, "}
{"Input":"Your fill what happiness this happy state ","Output":"Can comprehend, incapable of more. "}
{"Input":"Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest; ","Output":"Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves "}
{"Input":"And one peculiar nation to select ","Output":"From all the rest, of whom to be invoked, "}
{"Input":"Of his almighty engine, he shall hear ","Output":"Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see "}
{"Input":"Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, ","Output":"That wished the mountains now might be again "}
{"Input":"Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled ","Output":"To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz "}
{"Input":"In signal of remove, waves fiercely round: ","Output":"We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; "}
{"Input":"Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape. ","Output":"  These were the prime in order and in might: "}
{"Input":"As one who long in populous city pent, ","Output":"Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air, "}
{"Input":"Had from his wakeful custody purloined ","Output":"The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend "}
{"Input":"Between thee and the woman I will put ","Output":"Enmity, and between thine and her seed; "}
{"Input":"Arraying with reflected purple and gold ","Output":"The clouds that on his western throne attend. "}
{"Input":"With our own hands his office on ourselves: ","Output":"Why stand we longer shivering under fears, "}
{"Input":"From the first opening bud, and gave ye names! ","Output":"Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank "}
{"Input":"And call them not to share with us their part ","Output":"In this unhappy mansion, or once more "}
{"Input":"Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those male, ","Output":"These feminine. For Spirits, when they please, "}
{"Input":"Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend ","Output":"By living streams among the trees of life, "}
{"Input":"Of hazard as of honour, due alike ","Output":"To him who reigns, and so much to him due "}

{"Input":"Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home, ","Output":"While here shall be our home, what best may ease "}
{"Input":"Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom ","Output":"New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise, "}
{"Input":"Though not as she with bow and quiver armed, ","Output":"But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude, "}
{"Input":"So promised he; and Uriel to his charge ","Output":"Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised "}
{"Input":"A numerous host; in strength each armed hand ","Output":"A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed "}
{"Input":"Through the calm firmament, (but up or down, ","Output":"By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell, "}
{"Input":"Yet that we never shall forget to love ","Output":"Our Maker, and obey him whose command "}
{"Input":"Under what torments inwardly I groan, ","Output":"While they adore me on the throne of Hell. "}
{"Input":"New troubles; him thy care must be to find. ","Output":"To whom the winged warriour thus returned. "}
{"Input":"And with them comes a third of regal port, ","Output":"But faded splendour wan; who by his gait "}
{"Input":"Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand, ","Output":"Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit "}
{"Input":"Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound: ","Output":"Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, "}
{"Input":"Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse ","Output":"And pious awe, that feared to have offended. "}
{"Input":"Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail: ","Output":"So varied he, and of his tortuous train "}
{"Input":"That witnessed huge affliction and dismay, ","Output":"Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. "}
{"Input":"Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed, ","Output":"And all about found desolate; for those, "}
{"Input":"So spake this oracle, then verified ","Output":"When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve, "}
{"Input":"And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin ","Output":"Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. "}
{"Input":"Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; ","Output":"A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve, "}
{"Input":"'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes, ","Output":"'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire? "}
{"Input":"Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth ","Output":"Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire "}
{"Input":"Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring. ","Output":"And what are Gods, that Man may not become "}
{"Input":"I have in view, calling to mind with heed ","Output":"Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise "}
{"Input":"Sups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees ","Output":"Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines "}

{"Input":"Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape ","Output":"Man I deceived: that which to me belongs, "}
{"Input":"While smooth Adonis from his native rock ","Output":"Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood "}

{"Input":"Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full ","Output":"Resplendent all his Father manifest "}
{"Input":"Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, ","Output":"As this place testifies, and this dire change, "}
{"Input":"Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state ","Output":"Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek "}
{"Input":"Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground ","Output":"With solemn adoration down they cast "}
{"Input":"Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike ","Output":"To that first naked glory!  Such of late "}
{"Input":"Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit ","Output":"Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste "}
{"Input":"Of present pain that with ambitious mind ","Output":"Will covet more! With this advantage, then, "}
{"Input":"By death brought on ourselves, or childless days ","Output":"Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe "}

{"Input":"Above all hills.  As when by night the glass ","Output":"Of Galileo, less assured, observes "}
{"Input":"Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, ","Output":"And all who under me their banners wave, "}
{"Input":"Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, ","Output":"Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords "}
{"Input":"Though not but by the Spirit understood. ","Output":"Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, "}
{"Input":"None left but by submission; and that word ","Output":"Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame "}
{"Input":"By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last, ","Output":"Though comfortless; as when a father mourns "}
{"Input":"Though late repenting him of Man depraved; ","Output":"Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw "}
{"Input":"From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched ","Output":"In battailous aspect, and nearer view "}
{"Input":"And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond ","Output":"The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines, "}
{"Input":"Of battle, open when, and when to close ","Output":"The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight, "}
{"Input":"My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear, ","Output":"Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain, "}
{"Input":"As from her outmost works, a broken foe, ","Output":"With tumult less and with less hostile din; "}
{"Input":"Of hazard more as he above the rest ","Output":"High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers, "}
{"Input":"Observing none, but adoration pure ","Output":"Which God likes best, into their inmost bower "}
{"Input":"Orb within orb, the Father Infinite, ","Output":"By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son, "}
{"Input":"The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds. ","Output":"Then from his lofty stand on that high tree "}

{"Input":"And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach ","Output":"The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose "}
{"Input":"Holy and just:  Thrice happy, if they know ","Output":"Their happiness, and persevere upright! "}
{"Input":"Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut, ","Output":"The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong; "}
{"Input":"I pleased, and with attractive graces won ","Output":"The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft "}
{"Input":"Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears. ","Output":"Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field "}
{"Input":"Save when they journey, and at length they come, ","Output":"Conducted by his Angel, to the land "}
{"Input":"And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood ","Output":"One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven "}
{"Input":"God's indignation on these godless poured ","Output":"By me; not you, but me, they have despised, "}
{"Input":"Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath ","Output":"Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. "}
{"Input":"Outrageous to devour, immures us round ","Output":"Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant, "}
{"Input":"To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, ","Output":"Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured "}
{"Input":"Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam, ","Output":"The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff, "}
{"Input":"As good have grown there still a lifeless rib. ","Output":"Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head, "}
{"Input":" Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop ","Output":" Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed; "}
{"Input":"How few sometimes may know, when thousands err. ","Output":"Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance, "}
{"Input":"Amply have merited of me, of all ","Output":"The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door "}
{"Input":"Will envy whom the highest place exposes ","Output":"Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim "}
{"Input":"Circled his head, nor less his locks behind ","Output":"Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings "}
{"Input":"To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste; ","Output":"And hath been tasted such:  The serpent wise, "}
{"Input":"Now risen, to work them further woe or shame; ","Output":"Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, "}
{"Input":"To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom, ","Output":"Her nursery; they at her coming sprung, "}
{"Input":"With purpose to resign them, in full time, ","Output":"Up to a better covenant; disciplined "}
{"Input":"Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps ","Output":"I also erred, in overmuch admiring "}
{"Input":"Yet far the greater part have kept, I see, ","Output":"Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains "}
{"Input":"Inhospitably, and kills their infant males: ","Output":"Till by two brethren (these two brethren call "}

{"Input":"I could endure, without him live no life. ","Output":"So saying, from the tree her step she turned; "}
{"Input":"First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st ","Output":"To glorify thy Son, I always thee, "}
{"Input":"Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend ","Output":"Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food "}
{"Input":"This only to consult how we may best, ","Output":"With what may be devised of honours new, "}
{"Input":"Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place ","Output":"Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell "}
{"Input":"As to forsake the living God, and fall ","Output":"To worship their own work in wood and stone "}
{"Input":"Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined ","Output":"Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired. "}
{"Input":"Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which ","Output":"The world erelong a world of tears must weep. "}
{"Input":"Before thee reconciled, at least his days ","Output":"Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I "}
