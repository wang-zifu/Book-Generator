{"Input":"Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find ","Output":"Of erring, from the path of truth remote: "}
{"Input":"Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers: ","Output":"In yonder nether world where shall I seek "}
{"Input":"  These were the prime in order and in might: ","Output":"The rest were long to tell; though far renowned "}
{"Input":"'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!' ","Output":"So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, "}
{"Input":"Various, with boastful argument portrayed, ","Output":"The banded Powers of Satan hasting on "}
{"Input":"So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed ","Output":"So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored, "}
{"Input":"Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; ","Output":"But in his way lights on the barren plains "}
{"Input":"Poured out by millions her victorious bands, ","Output":"Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here "}

{"Input":"Of order, how in safety best we may ","Output":"Compose our present evils, with regard "}
{"Input":"To second, or oppose, or undertake ","Output":"The perilous attempt. But all sat mute, "}
{"Input":"Herself, though fairest unsupported flower, ","Output":"From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh. "}
{"Input":"Rather than death, or aught than death more dread, ","Output":"Shall separate us, linked in love so dear, "}
{"Input":"Loud as from numbers without number, sweet ","Output":"As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung "}
{"Input":"Defied the best of Paynim chivalry ","Output":"To mortal combat, or career with lance), "}
{"Input":"Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found ","Output":"In woman, than to study houshold good, "}
{"Input":"Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed, ","Output":"Immediately inordinate desires, "}
{"Input":"Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild. ","Output":"Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such "}
{"Input":"The universe, and to each inward part ","Output":"With gentle penetration, though unseen, "}
{"Input":"And various idols through the heathen world. ","Output":"  Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last, "}
{"Input":"A race of upstart creatures, to supply ","Output":"Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed, "}
{"Input":"This day I have begot whom I declare ","Output":"My only Son, and on this holy hill "}
{"Input":"And fear of death deliver to the winds. ","Output":"So saying, she embraced him, and for joy "}
{"Input":"I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof: ","Output":"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow "}
{"Input":"With golden architrave; nor did there want ","Output":"Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven; "}
{"Input":"In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; ","Output":"Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked: "}
{"Input":"Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, ","Output":"Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, "}
{"Input":"In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance, ","Output":"Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken "}

{"Input":"For strength from truth divided, and from just, ","Output":"Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise "}
{"Input":"Thy enemy; nor so is overcome ","Output":"Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise, "}
{"Input":"To be both will and deed created free; ","Output":"Yet that we never shall forget to love "}
{"Input":"Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed: ","Output":"But her with stern regard he thus repelled. "}
{"Input":"He for God only, she for God in him: ","Output":"His fair large front and eye sublime declared "}
{"Input":"Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last, ","Output":"Far in the horizon to the north appeared "}
{"Input":"Seek not temptation then, which to avoid ","Output":"Were better, and most likely if from me "}

{"Input":"But ended foul in many a scaly fold, ","Output":"Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed "}
{"Input":"Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven ","Output":"Expected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate, "}
{"Input":"And leave a singed bottom all involved ","Output":"With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole "}

{"Input":"Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he ","Output":"In temples and at altars, when the priest "}
{"Input":"Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring ","Output":"Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers, "}
{"Input":"Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand ","Output":"Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave "}
{"Input":"To find himself not matchless, and his pride ","Output":"Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath "}
{"Input":"I in thy persevering shall rejoice, ","Output":"And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall "}
{"Input":"Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease ","Output":"Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature: "}
{"Input":"God-like fruition, quitted all, to save ","Output":"A world from utter loss, and hast been found "}
{"Input":"Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night ","Output":"In Gibeah, when the hospitable door "}
{"Input":"New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date, ","Output":"Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love; "}
{"Input":"Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe. ","Output":"His spear--to equal which the tallest pine "}
{"Input":"Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb ","Output":"His inmost counsels from their destined aim. "}
{"Input":"Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names ","Output":"Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those male, "}
{"Input":"Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate ","Output":"Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide "}
{"Input":"So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers, ","Output":"Far was advanced on winged speed; an host "}
{"Input":"By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice ","Output":"Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring; "}
{"Input":"Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love ","Output":"Immense, and all his Father in him shone. "}
{"Input":"With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast, ","Output":"Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell "}
{"Input":"She all night long her amorous descant sung; ","Output":"Silence was pleased:  Now glowed the firmament "}
{"Input":"Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed, ","Output":"Not long divisible; and from the gash "}
{"Input":"The ethereal people ran, to hear and know ","Output":"How all befel:  They towards the throne supreme, "}
{"Input":"Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains ","Output":"Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss "}
{"Input":"Of battle now began, and rushing sound ","Output":"Of onset ended soon each milder thought. "}
{"Input":"That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream, ","Output":"Waking thou never will consent to do. "}
{"Input":"That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars ","Output":"Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; "}
{"Input":"Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed ","Output":"Submitting to what seemed remediless, "}
{"Input":"In vain, though by their powerful art they bind ","Output":"Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound "}
{"Input":"As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword, ","Output":"Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear. "}
{"Input":"Of mischief, and polluted from the end ","Output":"Of his creation; justly then accursed, "}
{"Input":"By my complaint: but strict necessity ","Output":"Subdues me, and calamitous constraint; "}
{"Input":"The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see ","Output":"Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout, "}
{"Input":"With silent circumspection, unespied. ","Output":"Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared, "}

{"Input":"And high permission of all-ruling Heaven ","Output":"Left him at large to his own dark designs, "}
{"Input":"The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud, ","Output":"Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth? "}
{"Input":"Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son. ","Output":"I know thee not, nor ever saw till now "}
{"Input":"Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown: ","Output":"The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs "}
{"Input":"Of some new race, called Man, about this time ","Output":"To be created like to us, though less "}
{"Input":"Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne ","Output":"Even to the seat of God.  For since I sought "}
{"Input":"And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled, ","Output":"And Discord with a thousand various mouths. "}
{"Input":"Disparted, and between spun out the air; ","Output":"And Earth self-balanced on her center hung. "}
{"Input":"Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, ","Output":"And these inferiour far beneath me set? "}
{"Input":"And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel ","Output":"Homeward returning.  High in front advanced, "}
{"Input":"Their nimble tread; as when the total kind ","Output":"Of birds, in orderly array on wing, "}
{"Input":"Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend ","Output":"Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while, "}
{"Input":"Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously ","Output":"The waters generated by their kinds; "}
{"Input":"Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold ","Output":"Empyreal; from before her vanished Night, "}
{"Input":"In Paradise, fast by the tree of life, ","Output":"Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence "}
{"Input":"So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found ","Output":"Among the faithless, faithful only he; "}
{"Input":"Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise, ","Output":"Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound: "}
{"Input":"Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels ","Output":"In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. "}
{"Input":"Army against army numberless to raise ","Output":"Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, "}
{"Input":"Instinct through all proportions, low and high, ","Output":"Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. "}
{"Input":"Upon his enemies, and to declare ","Output":"All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son, "}
{"Input":"Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb ","Output":"Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned: "}
{"Input":"So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, ","Output":"Severe in youthful beauty, added grace "}
{"Input":"  \"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,\" ","Output":"Said then the lost Archangel, \"this the seat "}
{"Input":"Of gesture, or least action, overawed ","Output":"His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved "}
{"Input":"His end, and frustrate thine?  shall he fulfill ","Output":"His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought, "}
{"Input":"Which to his evil conscience represented ","Output":"All things with double terrour:  On the ground "}
{"Input":"Some specious object by the foe suborned, ","Output":"And fall into deception unaware, "}
{"Input":"So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce ","Output":"Had ended; when to right and left the front "}
{"Input":"A world devote to universal wrack. ","Output":"No sooner he, with them of man and beast "}
{"Input":"Or of the Eternal coeternal beam ","Output":"May I express thee unblam'd?  since God is light, "}
{"Input":"New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise, ","Output":"Or down from Heaven descend.--Such was their song; "}
{"Input":"The quarters of the north; there to prepare ","Output":"Fit entertainment to receive our King, "}
{"Input":"His will who reigns above, to aggravate ","Output":"Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that "}
{"Input":"Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed, ","Output":"Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight "}
{"Input":"She ended weeping; and her lowly plight, ","Output":"Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault "}
{"Input":"A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed ","Output":"With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms. "}
{"Input":"How shall I part, and whither wander down ","Output":"Into a lower world; to this obscure "}
{"Input":"To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied. ","Output":"Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey "}
{"Input":"And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along; ","Output":"Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid; "}
{"Input":"Powerful at greatest distance to unite, ","Output":"With secret amity, things of like kind, "}
{"Input":"Too much of ornament, in outward show ","Output":"Elaborate, of inward less exact. "}
{"Input":"Still overcoming evil, and by small ","Output":"Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak "}
{"Input":"His?kithetmroboscis; close the serpent sly, ","Output":"Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine "}
{"Input":"Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe, ","Output":"And starry pole:  Thou also madest the night, "}
{"Input":"Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons, ","Output":"From Aroar to Nebo and the wild "}
{"Input":"The portal shone, inimitable on earth ","Output":"By model, or by shading pencil, drawn. "}
{"Input":"To whom mild answer Adam thus returned. ","Output":"Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond "}
{"Input":"Taste so divine, that what of sweet before ","Output":"Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name ","Output":"If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine "}
{"Input":"Though others envy what they cannot give: ","Output":"For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here "}
{"Input":"Eternal Father from his throne beheld ","Output":"Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake. "}
{"Input":"To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night; ","Output":"They gladly thither haste, and by a quire "}
{"Input":"Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; ","Output":"And with them comes a third of regal port, "}
{"Input":"Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, ","Output":"And into all things from her air inspired "}
{"Input":"More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods ","Output":"Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like "}
{"Input":"Since now we find this our empyreal form ","Output":"Incapable of mortal injury, "}
{"Input":"Like honour to obtain, and as his eye ","Output":"To visit oft this new creation round; "}
{"Input":"Celestial voices to the midnight air, ","Output":"Sole, or responsive each to others note, "}
{"Input":"Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once, ","Output":"Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent "}
{"Input":"As Delos, floating once; the rest his look ","Output":"Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move; "}
{"Input":"A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide, ","Output":"Wider by far than that of after-times "}
{"Input":"This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, ","Output":"And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, "}
{"Input":"Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft, ","Output":"With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws, "}
{"Input":"Of waters issued from a cave, and spread ","Output":"Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved "}
{"Input":"Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds ","Output":"Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles "}
{"Input":"Wrought still within them; and no less desire ","Output":"To found this nether empire, which might rise, "}
{"Input":"Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek. ","Output":"Therefore from this high pitch let us descend "}
{"Input":"Yet, by experience taught, we know how good, ","Output":"And of our good and of our dignity "}
{"Input":"Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest ","Output":"What hath been warned us, what malicious foe "}
{"Input":"She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold ","Output":"Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground "}
{"Input":"Were always downward bent, admiring more ","Output":"The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold, "}
{"Input":"Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp ","Output":"Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea, "}
{"Input":"Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned: ","Output":"I followed her; she what was honour knew, "}

{"Input":"Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess, ","Output":"Free and to none accountable, preferring "}
{"Input":"Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, ","Output":"Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear, "}
{"Input":"Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew ","Output":"His brother: for of whom such massacre "}
{"Input":"Whose virtue on itself works no effect, ","Output":"But in the fruitful Earth; there first received, "}
{"Input":"Adam, by sad experiment I know ","Output":"How little weight my words with thee can find, "}
{"Input":"The danger, and the lurking enemy ","Output":"That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force; "}
{"Input":"Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light, ","Output":"Secure, and at the brightening orient beam "}
{"Input":"And render me more equal; and perhaps, ","Output":"A thing not undesirable, sometime "}
{"Input":"To heavenly souls had been all one; but now ","Output":"I see that most through sloth had rather serve, "}
{"Input":"Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! ","Output":"To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. "}
{"Input":"Came summoned over Eden to receive ","Output":"Their names of thee; so over many a tract "}
{"Input":"With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er, ","Output":"Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb: "}
{"Input":"Of Him who all things can, I would not cease ","Output":"To weary him with my assiduous cries: "}
{"Input":"Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss, ","Output":"Yet willingly chose rather death with thee? "}
{"Input":"Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, ","Output":"And for thee, whose perfection far excelled "}
{"Input":"Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven, ","Output":"Servility with freedom to contend, "}
{"Input":"To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed. ","Output":"And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end "}
{"Input":"Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, ","Output":"Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot "}
{"Input":"And after him, the surer messenger, ","Output":"A dove sent forth once and again to spy "}

{"Input":" So on he fares, and to the border comes ","Output":" Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, "}
{"Input":"Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom, ","Output":"Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God, "}
{"Input":"Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance ","Output":"I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist "}
{"Input":"There let them learn, as likes them, to despise ","Output":"God, and Messiah his anointed King. "}
{"Input":"At certain revolutions all the damned ","Output":"Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change "}
{"Input":"By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook; ","Output":"As in an organ, from one blast of wind, "}
{"Input":"His vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose, ","Output":"As plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land "}
{"Input":"To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey; ","Output":"With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude. "}
{"Input":"Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm ","Output":"Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs: "}
{"Input":"Borne even or high; for this day will pour down, ","Output":"If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, "}
{"Input":"With supple joints, as lively vigour led: ","Output":"But who I was, or where, or from what cause, "}
{"Input":"Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared ","Output":"To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend "}
{"Input":"Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will; ","Output":"Yet not of will in him, but grace in me "}
{"Input":"Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still ","Output":"A day entire, and night's due course adjourn, "}
{"Input":"For ever, to remove him I decree, ","Output":"And send him from the garden forth to till "}
{"Input":"Against God and Messiah, or to fall ","Output":"In universal ruin last; and now "}
{"Input":"Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat, ","Output":"Or bedward ruminating; for the sun, "}
{"Input":"Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears ","Output":"Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth "}
{"Input":"These adamantine gates; against all force ","Output":"Death ready stands to interpose his dart, "}
{"Input":"Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love ","Output":"Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced; "}
{"Input":"Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse ","Output":"The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more, "}
{"Input":"Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords ","Output":"Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear "}
{"Input":"To better hopes his more attentive mind ","Output":"Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied. "}
{"Input":"Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch; ","Output":"And over them triumphant Death his dart "}
{"Input":"Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent ","Output":"Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. "}
{"Input":"Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill ","Output":"Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed "}
{"Input":"Portending hollow truce:  At each behind ","Output":"A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed "}
{"Input":"Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued ","Output":"And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss, "}
{"Input":"With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon ","Output":"Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape-- "}
{"Input":"Refusing to accept as great a share ","Output":"Of hazard as of honour, due alike "}
{"Input":"'Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called ","Output":"'Mother of human race.'  What could I do, "}
{"Input":"With glory and spoil, back to their promised land. ","Output":"But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies "}
{"Input":"That from his lordly eye keep distance due, ","Output":"Dispenses light from far; they, as they move "}
{"Input":"By right of war, whate'er his business be, ","Output":"Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire, "}
{"Input":"As father of his family, he clad ","Output":"Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, "}
{"Input":"Their great Commander--godlike Shapes, and Forms ","Output":"Excelling human; princely Dignities; "}
{"Input":"Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. ","Output":"Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light, "}
{"Input":"Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such ","Output":"Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me, "}
{"Input":"In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence ","Output":"Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, "}
{"Input":"Sown with contrition in his heart, than those ","Output":"Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees "}
{"Input":"For, high from ground, the branches would require ","Output":"Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree "}

{"Input":"A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves; ","Output":"Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown: "}
{"Input":"Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste! ","Output":"He ended; and his words, replete with guile, "}
{"Input":"Invested with bright rays, jocund to run ","Output":"His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray "}
{"Input":"Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer ","Output":"The guilt on him, who made him instrument "}
{"Input":"For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest: ","Output":"But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on "}
{"Input":"He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed ","Output":"With noises loud and ruinous (to compare "}
{"Input":"And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more ","Output":"Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse "}
{"Input":"Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become ","Output":"Of me and all mankind:  But now I see "}
{"Input":"Up to our native seat; descent and fall ","Output":"To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, "}
{"Input":"Insensibly three different motions move? ","Output":"Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe, "}
{"Input":"Who oft as undeservedly enthrall ","Output":"His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be; "}
{"Input":"Over the Caspian,--then stand front to front ","Output":"Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow "}
{"Input":"To me inferiour, infinite descents ","Output":"Beneath what other creatures are to thee? "}
{"Input":"The burden of many ages, on me light ","Output":"At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth "}
{"Input":"On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers: ","Output":"The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind, "}
{"Input":"The rigid interdiction, which resounds ","Output":"Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice "}
{"Input":"Not to do only, but to will the same ","Output":"With me?  How can they then acquitted stand "}
{"Input":"Heavy, though in their place.  O fleeting joys ","Output":"Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes! "}
{"Input":"All I received; unable to perform ","Output":"Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold "}
{"Input":"Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout, ","Output":"Presage of victory, and fierce desire "}
{"Input":"Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err ","Output":"The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw "}
{"Input":"Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. ","Output":"From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called "}
{"Input":"So saying, her rash hand in evil hour ","Output":"Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat! "}
{"Input":"In God's eternal store, to circumscribe ","Output":"This universe, and all created things: "}
{"Input":"So saying, she embraced him, and for joy ","Output":"Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love "}
{"Input":"Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall, ","Output":"For death, like that which the Redeemer died. "}
{"Input":"With many a vain exploit, though then renowned: ","Output":"The builders next of Babel on the plain "}
{"Input":"Chains and these torments? Better these than worse, ","Output":"By my advice; since fate inevitable "}
{"Input":"Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while ","Output":"Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds: "}
{"Input":"Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents ","Output":"Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race "}
{"Input":"Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, ","Output":"Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth, "}
{"Input":"Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound ","Output":"Within the visible diurnal sphere; "}
{"Input":"Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake. ","Output":"O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd "}
{"Input":"What it intends, till first I know of thee ","Output":"What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, "}
{"Input":"Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice ","Output":"More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage "}
{"Input":"Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood ","Output":"So high above the circling canopy "}
{"Input":"Idol of majesty divine, enclosed ","Output":"With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields; "}
{"Input":"And as ye have received, so have ye done, ","Output":"Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew "}
{"Input":"Inglorious life with servitude; for life ","Output":"To noble and ignoble is more sweet "}
{"Input":"Yawning received them whole, and on them closed; ","Output":"Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire "}
{"Input":"In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour, ","Output":"Satisfied never?  That were to extend "}
{"Input":"But drive far off the barbarous dissonance ","Output":"Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race "}
{"Input":"Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none, ","Output":"That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise: "}
{"Input":"(And if one day, why not eternal days?) ","Output":"What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send "}
{"Input":"As a distemper, gross, to air as gross, ","Output":"And mortal food; as may dispose him best "}
{"Input":"Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, ","Output":"To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye: "}
{"Input":"The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death, ","Output":"Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke "}
{"Input":"Active within, beyond the sense of brute. ","Output":"Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief "}
{"Input":"O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve, ","Output":"Of thy presumed return! event perverse! "}
{"Input":"Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky. ","Output":"As I bent down to look, just opposite "}
{"Input":"Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, ","Output":"Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid; "}
{"Input":"His secrets to be scanned by them who ought ","Output":"Rather admire; or, if they list to try "}
{"Input":"The doubts that in his heart arose: and now ","Output":"Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know "}
{"Input":"But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire. ","Output":"So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon "}
{"Input":"His blessed countenance:  Here I could frequent ","Output":"With worship place by place where he vouchsafed "}
{"Input":"Invincible, and vigour soon returns, ","Output":"Though all our glory extinct, and happy state "}
{"Input":"Conferred upon us, and dominion given ","Output":"Over all other creatures that possess "}
{"Input":"And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds ","Output":"Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; "}

{"Input":"Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites ","Output":"Established, such delight hath God in Men "}
{"Input":"Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. ","Output":"Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night "}

{"Input":"So all was cleared, and to the field they haste. ","Output":"But first, from under shady arborous roof "}
{"Input":"To me, who with eternal famine pine, ","Output":"Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven; "}
{"Input":"Of difficulty or danger, could deter ","Output":"Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume "}
{"Input":"Unskilful with what words to pray, let me ","Output":"Interpret for him; me, his advocate "}
{"Input":"A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here ","Output":"Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will "}
{"Input":"Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game ","Output":"To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped "}
{"Input":"What may suffice, and soften stony hearts ","Output":"To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. "}
{"Input":"(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) ","Output":"Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment "}
{"Input":"To the terrestrial moon be as a star, ","Output":"Enlightening her by day, as she by night "}
{"Input":"Exempt from death; to show thee what reward ","Output":"Awaits the good; the rest what punishment; "}
{"Input":"(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe ","Output":"Clear victory; to our part loss and rout "}
{"Input":"As if (which might induce us to accord) ","Output":"Man had not hellish foes enow besides, "}
{"Input":"And princely counsel in his face yet shone, ","Output":"Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood "}
{"Input":"Patron of liberty, who more than thou ","Output":"Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored "}
{"Input":"Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen ","Output":"Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb, "}
{"Input":"Raised, as of some great matter to begin. ","Output":"As when of old some orator renowned, "}
{"Input":"Of happiness, or not? who am alone ","Output":"From all eternity; for none I know "}
{"Input":"Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey ","Output":"Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk "}
{"Input":"Single with like defence, wherever met; ","Output":"How are we happy, still in fear of harm? "}
{"Input":"Till many years over thy head return: ","Output":"So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop "}
{"Input":"For regal scepter then no more shall need, ","Output":"God shall be all in all.  But, all ye Gods, "}
{"Input":"In the wide womb of uncreated Night, ","Output":"Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, "}
{"Input":"Under their God-like leaders, in the cause ","Output":"Of God and his Messiah.  On they move "}
{"Input":"For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce, ","Output":"Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring "}
{"Input":"Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose: ","Output":"When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, "}
{"Input":"Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear, ","Output":"And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil "}

{"Input":"Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud. ","Output":"Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet "}
{"Input":"Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid. ","Output":"I, from the influence of thy looks, receive "}
{"Input":"Which of them rising with the sun, or falling, ","Output":"Should prove tempestuous:  To the winds they set "}
{"Input":"Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, ","Output":"And elegant, of sapience no small part; "}
{"Input":"Our day's work, brought to little, though begun ","Output":"Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned? "}
{"Input":"Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed, ","Output":"Here in the dark so many precious things "}
{"Input":"Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, ","Output":"Belike through impotence or unaware, "}
{"Input":"Conjured against the Highest--for which both thou ","Output":"And they, outcast from God, are here condemned "}
{"Input":"Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish, ","Output":"Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, "}
{"Input":"Receive, no more than can the fluid air: ","Output":"All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear, "}
{"Input":"Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth; ","Output":"Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill "}
{"Input":"Considered every creature, which of all ","Output":"Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found "}
{"Input":"Absents thee, or what chance detains?--Come forth! ","Output":"He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first "}
{"Input":"Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven ","Output":"Grateful vicissitude, like day and night; "}
{"Input":"Our being ordained to govern, not to serve. ","Output":"Thus far his bold discourse without controul "}
{"Input":"The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes ","Output":"Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net "}
{"Input":"Between us two let there be peace; both joining, ","Output":"As joined in injuries, one enmity "}
{"Input":"Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows ","Output":"But might as ill have happened thou being by, "}
{"Input":"By spiritual, to themselves appropriating ","Output":"The Spirit of God, promised alike and given "}
{"Input":"Of erring, from the path of truth remote: ","Output":"Unjustly thou depravest it with the name "}
{"Input":"And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow ","Output":"All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord: "}
{"Input":"Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy ","Output":"Congratulant approached him; who with hand "}
{"Input":"High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide ","Output":"The day from night; and let them be for signs, "}
{"Input":"He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee ","Output":"His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth "}
{"Input":"Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power ","Output":"Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, "}
{"Input":"Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star ","Output":"Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams "}
{"Input":"But first, a long succession must ensue; ","Output":"And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed, "}
{"Input":"I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged! ","Output":"Thus Adam to himself lamented loud, "}
{"Input":"On either side, the least of whom could wield ","Output":"These elements, and arm him with the force "}
{"Input":"And seems a moving land; and at his gills ","Output":"Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea. "}
{"Input":"Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark, ","Output":"Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great) "}
{"Input":"United, as one individual soul, ","Output":"For ever happy:  Him who disobeys, "}
{"Input":"Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure ","Output":"Touch of celestial temper, but returns "}
{"Input":"Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires ","Output":"From us no other service than to keep "}
{"Input":"With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air; ","Output":"So started up in his own shape the Fiend. "}
{"Input":"Equal in number to that Godless crew ","Output":"Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms "}
{"Input":"Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste; ","Output":"Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives; "}
{"Input":"While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps, ","Output":"Between us two let there be peace; both joining, "}
{"Input":"My heart, which by a secret harmony ","Output":"Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet, "}
{"Input":"This intellectual food, for beasts reserved? ","Output":"For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first "}
{"Input":"In search of this new World? whom shall we find ","Output":"Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet "}
{"Input":"Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont ","Output":"Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, "}
{"Input":"By him corrupted?  or wilt thou thyself ","Output":"Abolish thy creation, and unmake "}
{"Input":"Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb ","Output":"Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons, "}
{"Input":"  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub ","Output":"Thus answered:--\"Leader of those armies bright "}
{"Input":"The Devil entered; and his brutal sense, ","Output":"In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired "}
{"Input":"His rivals, winning cheap the high repute ","Output":"Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they "}
{"Input":"His generation, and the rising birth ","Output":"Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: "}
{"Input":"Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad ","Output":"Her universal face with pleasant green; "}
{"Input":"Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed! ","Output":"So saying, his proud step he scornful turned, "}
{"Input":"Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold ","Output":"And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet "}
{"Input":"On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, ","Output":"Illustrious far and wide; but by his own "}
{"Input":"The throne of God unguarded, and his side ","Output":"Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power "}
{"Input":"But with addition strange; yet be not sad. ","Output":"Evil into the mind of God or Man "}
{"Input":"Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds, ","Output":"Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, "}
{"Input":"So many grateful altars I would rear ","Output":"Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone "}
{"Input":"Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven ","Output":"He to his own a Comforter will send, "}
{"Input":"I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; ","Output":"Till pride and worse ambition threw me down "}
{"Input":"Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground ","Output":"With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed. "}
{"Input":"Belial, in act more graceful and humane. ","Output":"A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed "}
{"Input":"Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, ","Output":"Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest. "}
{"Input":"On penalty of death, and suffering death; ","Output":"The penalty to thy transgression due, "}
{"Input":"Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid. ","Output":"Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve "}
{"Input":"Of all things made, and judgest only right. ","Output":"Or shall the Adversary thus obtain "}
{"Input":"To whom the Tempter guilefully replied. ","Output":"Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit "}
{"Input":"Erect the standard there of ancient Night. ","Output":"Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!\" "}
{"Input":"The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired; ","Output":"Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive "}

{"Input":"Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub, ","Output":"And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last "}
{"Input":"Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find ","Output":"Some easier enterprise? There is a place "}
{"Input":"Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern ","Output":"Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find "}

{"Input":"Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move ","Output":"His laughter at their quaint opinions wide "}
{"Input":"Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out, ","Output":"For anger's sake, finite to infinite, "}
{"Input":"Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. ","Output":"To satisfy the sharp desire I had "}
{"Input":"Their inward state of mind, calm region once ","Output":"And full of peace, now tost and turbulent: "}
{"Input":"Neither our own, but given:  What folly then ","Output":"To boast what arms can do? since thine no more "}
{"Input":"Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost, ","Output":"Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new, "}
{"Input":"Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went ","Output":"With unexperienced thought, and laid me down "}
{"Input":"Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard ","Output":"Celestial voices to the midnight air, "}
{"Input":"That under ground they fought in dismal shade; ","Output":"Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game "}
{"Input":"Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, ","Output":"And guided by his voice; nor uninformed "}
{"Input":"The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed ","Output":"A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay "}
{"Input":"Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned ","Output":"Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; "}
{"Input":"Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see, ","Output":"Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil; "}
{"Input":"But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven ","Output":"Must re-ascend, what will betide the few "}
{"Input":"Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within ","Output":"Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then "}
{"Input":"To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide ","Output":"Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike "}
{"Input":"Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile! ","Output":"Too much to one! but double how endured, "}
{"Input":"But might as ill have happened thou being by, ","Output":"Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there, "}
{"Input":"So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate, ","Output":"Giving to death, and dying to redeem, "}
{"Input":"Decrepit winter; from the south to bring ","Output":"Solstitial summer's heat.  To the blanc moon "}
{"Input":"Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell, ","Output":"Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down "}
{"Input":"So threatened he; but Satan to no threats ","Output":"Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. "}
{"Input":"Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung ","Output":"By the celestial quires, when orient light "}
{"Input":"Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed ","Output":"Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew, "}
{"Input":"Through ways of danger by himself untried: ","Output":"I, therefore, I alone first undertook "}

{"Input":"Of good and evil much they argued then, ","Output":"Of happiness and final misery, "}
{"Input":"Her universal face with pleasant green; ","Output":"Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered "}
{"Input":"But all these in their pregnant causes mixed ","Output":"Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, "}
{"Input":"One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself. ","Output":"So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied. "}
{"Input":"And in their motions harmony divine ","Output":"So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear "}
{"Input":"Immutably his sovran will, the end ","Output":"Of what we are.  But since thou hast vouchsafed "}
{"Input":"O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest ","Output":"Should yet remain, where faith and realty "}
{"Input":"The heavens and all the constellations rung, ","Output":"The planets in their station listening stood, "}
{"Input":"O Sons, like one of us Man is become ","Output":"To know both good and evil, since his taste "}
{"Input":"Their course, in even balance down they light ","Output":"On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain: "}
{"Input":"Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds ","Output":"Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old "}
{"Input":"Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field ","Output":"I knew, but not with human voice endued; "}
{"Input":"Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. ","Output":"But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account "}
{"Input":"  \"Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire, ","Output":"And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge "}

{"Input":"Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth, ","Output":"And in her pale dominion checks the night. "}
{"Input":"Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound; ","Output":"On me, as on their natural center, light "}
{"Input":"Each other, till supplanted down he fell ","Output":"A monstrous serpent on his belly prone, "}
{"Input":"His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid, ","Output":"I mean to try, whose reason I have tried "}
{"Input":"Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance ","Output":"With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon "}
{"Input":"Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. ","Output":"Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled "}
{"Input":"And love with fear the only God; to walk ","Output":"As in his presence; ever to observe "}
{"Input":"Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies, ","Output":"And after him, the surer messenger, "}
{"Input":"That all these puissant legions, whose exile ","Output":"Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend, "}
{"Input":"The bottom of the mountains upward turned; ","Output":"Till on those cursed engines' triple-row "}
{"Input":"Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. ","Output":"Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; "}
{"Input":"Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose ","Output":"Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers, "}
{"Input":"Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed ","Output":"In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons, "}
{"Input":" Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. ","Output":" His words here ended; but his meek aspect "}
{"Input":"Incessant I could hope to change the will ","Output":"Of Him who all things can, I would not cease "}
{"Input":"So many nobler bodies to create, ","Output":"Greater so manifold, to this one use, "}
{"Input":"With foes, for daring single to be just, ","Output":"And utter odious truth, that God would come "}
{"Input":"Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best: ","Output":"And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. "}
{"Input":"Yet sometimes nations will decline so low ","Output":"From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong, "}
{"Input":"To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. ","Output":"God, to remove his ways from human sense, "}
{"Input":"In horrible destruction laid thus low, ","Output":"As far as Gods and heavenly Essences "}
{"Input":"And morning chorus sung the second day. ","Output":"The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet "}
{"Input":"The sport of winds:  All these, upwhirled aloft, ","Output":"Fly o'er the backside of the world far off "}
{"Input":"Of peaceful days portends, than those two past; ","Output":"Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse; "}
{"Input":"Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing ","Output":"Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane "}
{"Input":"The image of God in Man, created once ","Output":"So goodly and erect, though faulty since, "}
{"Input":"Works of day past, or morrow's next design, ","Output":"But of offence and trouble, which my mind "}
{"Input":"For on some message high they guessed him bound. ","Output":"Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come "}
{"Input":"Engendering with me, of that rape begot ","Output":"These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry "}
{"Input":"Deliberation sat, and public care; ","Output":"And princely counsel in his face yet shone, "}
