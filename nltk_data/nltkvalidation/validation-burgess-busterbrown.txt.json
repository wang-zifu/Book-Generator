{"Input":"It was a long, long, long way down to the ground, and it certainly\r","Output":"looked as if such a little fellow as Chatterer must be killed. But\r"}

{"Input":"\"Now I guess Farmer Brown's boy will keep away from the Green Forest,\r","Output":"and we won't have to be all the time watching out for him,\" said Bobby\r"}

{"Input":"But this little pool, instead of being beautiful and clear so that\r","Output":"Buster could see right to the bottom of it and so tell if there were any\r"}
{"Input":"\"You ought to know, Sammy Jay,\" said he. \"I hope you'll always remember\r","Output":"it.\"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"It isn't very often that Chatterer the Red Squirrel knows fear. That is\r"}

{"Input":"as it isn't anger, of course it must be fear.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"BUSTER BEAR GOES FISHING\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Where is he now?\" asked Billy Mink.\r"}
{"Input":"whistle as he felt like doing, and he tried not to make a bit of noise\r","Output":"as he followed an old cow-path towards a place where he knew the berries\r"}

{"Input":"or three swam right in close to where he was sitting. Now Buster Bear\r","Output":"may be big and clumsy looking, but there isn't anything that can move\r"}
{"Input":"catches more fish than he can eat, but then he usually hides them. The\r","Output":"farther he went down the Laughing Brook, the more puzzled Farmer Brown's\r"}
{"Input":"every one who lives there knew about it. Of course, Peter Rabbit helped\r","Output":"spread it. Trust Peter for that! But everybody else helped too. You see,\r"}
{"Input":"all sat in a great circle around him, each where he felt safe, but where\r","Output":"he could see, and every one of them laughing and making fun of Buster.\r"}
{"Input":"but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling, and away he went without\r","Output":"once turning his head to see if Buster Bear was after him. There wasn't\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"So he went on to the next little pool. He found this just as muddy as\r"}
{"Input":"he went fishing in the Laughing Brook and had no luck at all. There are\r","Output":"just two things that make hair rise--anger and fear. Anger sometimes\r"}
{"Input":"grind his teeth and glare up at them, but that was all he could do. He\r","Output":"couldn't get at them. He just had to stand it and do nothing. But when\r"}

{"Input":"BLACKY THE CROW TELLS HIS PLAN\r","Output":"\r"}

{"Input":"Buster when they met him, or said them so that he would hear them.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"Buster clawed at that awful thing on his head more frantically than\r","Output":"ever. Suddenly it slipped off, so that he could see. He gave one\r"}
{"Input":"turned down the Laughing Brook, taking the greatest care to keep out of\r","Output":"sight themselves. They had gone only a little way when Billy Mink\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Thank you,\" replied Buster, and his eyes twinkled more than ever. \"I\r"}

{"Input":"did do. Of course he upset the pail, but he didn't mind a little thing\r","Output":"like that. When he had gobbled up all the berries that rolled out, he\r"}
{"Input":"Billy Mink just had to laugh. The idea of great big Buster Bear getting\r","Output":"drowned in the Laughing Brook was too funny. There wasn't water enough\r"}
{"Input":"after Sammy.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"in the Old Pasture all summer, but when he saw Buster, he was just as\r","Output":"badly frightened as Buster himself. In fact, he was too surprised and\r"}
{"Input":"he heard a shrill, angry voice shout, \"Hi, there! Get out of there!\" He\r","Output":"didn't need to be told whose voice that was. It was the voice of Farmer\r"}
{"Input":"frightened look at Farmer Brown's boy, and then with a mighty \"Woof!\" he\r","Output":"started for the Green Forest as fast as his legs could take him, and\r"}
{"Input":"When Farmer Brown's boy disappeared in the barn, Chatterer the Red\r","Output":"Squirrel snickered right out loud. \"Ha, ha, ha! This is a great plan of\r"}

{"Input":"at. Farmer Brown had laughed and laughed.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"would be, he would see him coming. Then, instead of keeping on to the\r","Output":"little pool, he hurried to a place way down the Laughing Brook, where\r"}
{"Input":"the Green Forest, still screaming in the most excited way. They felt\r","Output":"sure that Farmer Brown's boy would follow them, and they meant to lead\r"}
{"Input":"the Crow, trying to catch up and yelling as loud as he could, \"Caw,\r","Output":"caw, caw! Come on, everybody! Come on! Come on!\"\r"}
{"Input":"the Green Forest that not the least little sound could be heard. What\r","Output":"was going to happen?\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Now though Buster didn't know it, some one had been listening, and that\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"BUSTER BEAR BECOMES A HERO\r"}
{"Input":"and that you didn't want anybody else to know. And suppose you had the\r","Output":"habit of talking to yourself. You might, without thinking, you know,\r"}
{"Input":"  In spite of these he runs away\r","Output":"  And hides himself the livelong day!\"\r"}
{"Input":"he could, he understood what had excited Sammy so. He was so surprised\r","Output":"that he almost forgot to keep his wings moving. Buster Bear had what\r"}
{"Input":"hiding place, laughing and making fun of him. It was more than any\r","Output":"self-respecting Bear could stand.\r"}

{"Input":"some. It seemed to him that never in all his life had he wanted berries\r","Output":"as he did now. He wandered about uneasily. He was hungry--hungry for\r"}
{"Input":"than ever, until his voice grew so hoarse he couldn't scream any more,\r","Output":"but Farmer Brown's boy kept right on to the barn.\r"}
{"Input":"hanging from his neck! He didn't want it. He would have given anything\r","Output":"to get rid of it. But he took it because he couldn't help it. And that\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"I'll believe it when I see it for myself!\" snapped Blacky the Crow.\r"}
{"Input":"XIII\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"about the right or wrong of helping himself. There before him were more\r","Output":"berries than he had ever seen together at one time in all his life, and\r"}

{"Input":"He walked over to the place where the pail had been, and then he\r","Output":"remembered that when Buster ran away he had carried the pail with him,\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"When he reached the first little pool he baited his hook very carefully\r"}
{"Input":"put down his pail and began a hurried look here, there, and everywhere.\r","Output":"He was sure that it had come from somewhere on the ground, so he peered\r"}
{"Input":"those two-legged creatures called men. It seems funny but he actually is\r","Output":"afraid of them. And he had a feeling that he was a great deal more\r"}
{"Input":"one else had any right to fish there. To be sure Bobby Coon caught a few\r","Output":"little fish there, but they didn't mind Bobby. Farmer Brown's boy fished\r"}
{"Input":"and we won't have to be all the time watching out for him,\" said Bobby\r","Output":"Coon, as he washed his dinner in the Laughing Brook, for you know he is\r"}
{"Input":"\"I wish I never had thought of berries,\" growled Buster to himself.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"He's fishing!\" exclaimed Billy Mink.\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"Buster Bear hadn't actually taken the fish away from Little Joe. But\r"}
{"Input":"that, you know, was a long, long, long time ago. If you want to find Mr.\r","Output":"Bear, you will have to go to the Great Woods. I don't know who made that\r"}

{"Input":"Little Joe Otter was fairly bursting with excitement. He could hardly\r","Output":"contain himself. He felt that he had the greatest news to tell since\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Now having one's own way too much is a bad thing. It is apt to make one\r"}
{"Input":"first time, he had supposed that it was one of the young cattle who live\r","Output":"in the Old Pasture all summer, but when he saw Buster, he was just as\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"For a minute no one said a word. Then Blacky the Crow leaned down from\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,\" said he, as Little Joe put his head out\r"}
