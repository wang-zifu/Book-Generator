{"Input":"I believe, several years.\"","Output":"\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face"}
{"Input":"I knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is","Output":"anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,"}
{"Input":"If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than","Output":"former happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt,"}
{"Input":"She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine","Output":"naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike."}
{"Input":"variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday","Output":"and today there could scarcely be an end."}

{"Input":"without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,","Output":"without display; he judged for himself in everything essential,"}
{"Input":"He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;","Output":"younger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\""}

{"Input":"\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.","Output":"I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night."}
{"Input":"I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man","Output":"breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;"}
{"Input":"and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity","Output":"for longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused"}

{"Input":"between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.","Output":"But this was not all which they had to make them happy."}
{"Input":"When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again","Output":"for what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street"}
{"Input":"at least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,","Output":"in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained"}
{"Input":"The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered","Output":"by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;"}
{"Input":"and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance","Output":"of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right"}
{"Input":"In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which","Output":"was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,"}
{"Input":"Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;","Output":"a most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;"}
{"Input":"I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect","Output":"that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,"}
{"Input":"by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.","Output":"The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those"}
{"Input":"that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  In person, she was","Output":"inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached"}
{"Input":"comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility","Output":"of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant"}

{"Input":"who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not","Output":"have received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have"}
{"Input":"the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,","Output":"at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,"}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,","Output":"but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required"}
{"Input":"and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off","Output":"some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing"}
{"Input":"Chapter 22","Output":"Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,"}
{"Input":"by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,","Output":"that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer"}
{"Input":"sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?","Output":"The answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing."}
{"Input":"not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best","Output":"that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,"}
{"Input":"She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;","Output":"but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,"}
{"Input":"as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old","Output":"sooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life."}
{"Input":"When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,","Output":"which, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been"}

{"Input":"and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to","Output":"by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,"}
{"Input":"It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth","Output":"would not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,"}
{"Input":"very extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.","Output":"How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,"}
{"Input":"She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,","Output":"and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,"}
{"Input":"an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description","Output":"could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,"}

{"Input":"which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.","Output":"Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you"}
{"Input":"Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.","Output":"They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;"}
{"Input":"for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would","Output":"be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;"}
{"Input":"and it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother's feelings,","Output":"are a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles"}

{"Input":"As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,","Output":"the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret"}
{"Input":"that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution","Output":"to give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of"}

{"Input":"Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew","Output":"such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival"}
{"Input":"of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would","Output":"accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves."}
{"Input":"Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,","Output":"and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,"}
{"Input":"of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.","Output":"The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,"}
{"Input":"Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied","Output":"that she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,"}

{"Input":"and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,","Output":"and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment's pause, \"but you have never asked me","Output":"one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\""}
{"Input":"\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.","Output":"You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight"}
{"Input":"\"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,","Output":"and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be"}

{"Input":"before she could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was","Output":"not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard"}
{"Input":"all day long.","Output":"Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,"}
{"Input":"but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.","Output":"A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;"}
{"Input":"They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was","Output":"much the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared."}
{"Input":"Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,","Output":"pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been"}
{"Input":"She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing","Output":"could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects"}
{"Input":"a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,","Output":"said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,"}
{"Input":"state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick","Output":"was very great."}
{"Input":"he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.","Output":"Pity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief."}
{"Input":"having them accepted.","Output":"A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one."}
{"Input":"assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband","Output":"to all who needed them."}
{"Input":"quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against","Output":"the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment."}
{"Input":"a little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,","Output":"just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation."}
{"Input":"He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.","Output":"He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath"}
{"Input":"must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of","Output":"the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,"}
{"Input":"They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was","Output":"very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him"}
{"Input":"at the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed","Output":"to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above"}
{"Input":"now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him,","Output":"though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible"}
{"Input":"more than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;","Output":"consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation"}
{"Input":"and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced","Output":"his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;"}
{"Input":"\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,","Output":"with affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;"}
{"Input":"of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied","Output":"against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth as well as herself.","Output":"He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,"}
{"Input":"He had passed out of the room without a look!","Output":"She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where"}
{"Input":"(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply","Output":"to Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace"}
{"Input":"a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.","Output":"This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it"}
{"Input":"I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\"","Output":"Chapter 24"}
{"Input":"Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened","Output":"to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined"}
{"Input":"to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,","Output":"as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful"}
{"Input":"come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:","Output":"but she would rather have caught his eye."}
{"Input":"of there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,","Output":"and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,"}
{"Input":"Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to","Output":"urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same"}
{"Input":"was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,","Output":"more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had"}
{"Input":"\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"","Output":"\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;"}
{"Input":"to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one","Output":"much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,"}
{"Input":"is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.","Output":"She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;"}
{"Input":"which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,","Output":"she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found"}
{"Input":"containing nearly as much more.","Output":"\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa"}
{"Input":"of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and","Output":"benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out"}
{"Input":"the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!","Output":"I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment"}
{"Input":"She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.","Output":"Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;"}
{"Input":"been difficulties.","Output":"They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was"}
{"Input":"Can any thing be stronger?\"","Output":"Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification"}
{"Input":"behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without","Output":"assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,"}
{"Input":"Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;","Output":"nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,"}
{"Input":"a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong","Output":"understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,"}
{"Input":"fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,","Output":"had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration"}
{"Input":"in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench","Output":"before the concert closed."}
{"Input":"and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others","Output":"still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,"}
{"Input":"I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy","Output":"to change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better"}
{"Input":"the words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.","Output":"\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,"}
{"Input":"His regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole","Output":"solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,"}
{"Input":"you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined","Output":"not to judge him beforehand.\""}
{"Input":"though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew","Output":"was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of"}
{"Input":"and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,","Output":"she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her."}
{"Input":"and the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing","Output":"his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,"}
{"Input":"\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,","Output":"are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings"}
{"Input":"\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.","Output":"\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours"}
{"Input":"could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions","Output":"which conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,"}
{"Input":"for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down","Output":"towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;"}
{"Input":"the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.","Output":"With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,"}
{"Input":"to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,","Output":"when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming"}
{"Input":"to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found","Output":"a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had"}
{"Input":"she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,","Output":"or the sound of his artificial good sentiments."}
{"Input":"Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,","Output":"and in a calmer manner, she added,"}
{"Input":"and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!","Output":"Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you."}
{"Input":"by no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress","Output":"during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal"}
{"Input":"Shall I take any message?\"","Output":"\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,"}
{"Input":"\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose","Output":"you will not like to call at the Great House before they have"}
{"Input":"and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?  Do not you agree with me,","Output":"that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?"}
{"Input":"but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom","Output":"he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her."}
{"Input":"Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:","Output":"but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed"}
{"Input":"or in some respect saying what should not be said.\"","Output":"\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,"}
{"Input":"but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost","Output":"a matter of course.  Though better endowed than the elder sister,"}
{"Input":"how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father","Output":"this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,","Output":"equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of"}
{"Input":"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"","Output":"As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them"}
{"Input":"\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness","Output":"to be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect"}
{"Input":"business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,","Output":"and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\""}
{"Input":"that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment","Output":"it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest"}
{"Input":"which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.","Output":"Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,"}
{"Input":"had not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out","Output":"if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,"}
{"Input":"and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,","Output":"may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being"}
{"Input":"for their comforts, we must all allow.\"","Output":"\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\""}
{"Input":"of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do","Output":"for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,"}
{"Input":"this picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart","Output":"were bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;"}
{"Input":"more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had","Output":"appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,"}
{"Input":"in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her","Output":"having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,"}
{"Input":"and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross","Output":"its cheerful character.  A few days had made a change indeed!"}
{"Input":"from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side","Output":"was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk"}
{"Input":"\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as","Output":"they were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross"}
{"Input":"on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,","Output":"which a few hours might comprehend."}
{"Input":"it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised","Output":"in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come"}
{"Input":"of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all","Output":"the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant"}
{"Input":"\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"","Output":"\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\""}
{"Input":"and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything","Output":"to take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude"}
{"Input":"pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,","Output":"and make the best of it, as many others have done before them."}
{"Input":"so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may","Output":"be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\""}
{"Input":"as on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,","Output":"before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been"}
{"Input":"which carried them through the greater part of the morning,","Output":"was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend"}
{"Input":"he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary","Output":"to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was"}
{"Input":"It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,","Output":"and soon added in a different tone--"}
{"Input":"It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,","Output":"was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme."}
{"Input":"amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,","Output":"the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless"}
{"Input":"and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,","Output":"she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman"}
{"Input":"began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting","Output":"still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne"}
{"Input":"and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily","Output":"engrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,"}
{"Input":"of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,","Output":"which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --"}
{"Input":"\"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,","Output":"when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget"}
{"Input":"was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.","Output":"She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of"}
{"Input":"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back","Output":"till to-morrow.\""}
{"Input":"it will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.","Output":"She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin\""}
{"Input":"uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.","Output":"She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;"}
{"Input":"with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.","Output":"She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,"}
{"Input":"\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,","Output":"for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head,"}
{"Input":"and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude","Output":"or of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,"}
{"Input":"and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.","Output":"Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have"}
{"Input":"to the window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle,","Output":"but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;"}
{"Input":"\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,","Output":"and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to."}
{"Input":"not understand it.  But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;","Output":"for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being"}
{"Input":"we may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we","Output":"have that over, we can enjoy our walk.\""}
{"Input":"from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,","Output":"or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him"}
{"Input":"that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve","Output":"equally well, and who have always been such good friends,"}
{"Input":"\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's","Output":"time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance"}
{"Input":"\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not","Output":"appear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether"}
{"Input":"had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to","Output":"come to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;"}
{"Input":"of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.","Output":"All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely"}
{"Input":"or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.","Output":"How mortifying to feel that it was so!"}
{"Input":"the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing","Output":"among a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,"}
{"Input":"to any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture","Output":"of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,"}
{"Input":"some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.","Output":"He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home."}
{"Input":"\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies","Output":"had not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be out"}
{"Input":"they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement","Output":"could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions"}
{"Input":"as I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.","Output":"Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,"}
{"Input":"if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural","Output":"effect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician"}
{"Input":"The holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had","Output":"such long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,"}
{"Input":"He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,","Output":"however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said","Output":"it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised"}
{"Input":"kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship","Output":"which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account"}
{"Input":"truly!\"","Output":"Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,"}
{"Input":"It must have been about the same time that he became known to","Output":"my father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;"}
{"Input":"after thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,","Output":"at Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement."}
{"Input":"to plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see","Output":"that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not"}
{"Input":"A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think","Output":"it might be a very happy one.\""}
{"Input":"she could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand","Output":"his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much"}
{"Input":"was it not all against me?\"","Output":"\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have"}
{"Input":"Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,","Output":"shook her head, and exclaimed--"}
{"Input":"and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among","Output":"the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,"}
{"Input":"of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs","Output":"shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,"}
{"Input":"against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and","Output":"the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious"}
{"Input":"Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;","Output":"and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,"}
{"Input":"and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage","Output":"with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,"}
{"Input":"it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly","Output":"into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which"}
{"Input":"and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,","Output":"that it was very evident they would not have more than time"}
{"Input":"what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;","Output":"then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain"}
{"Input":"\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew","Output":"what you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,"}
{"Input":"be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known","Output":"how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,"}
{"Input":"this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you","Output":"in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?"}
{"Input":"in the midst of the Elliot countenance.","Output":"With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,"}
{"Input":"This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it","Output":"was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,"}
{"Input":"not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described","Output":"the woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,"}
{"Input":"\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect","Output":"in a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making"}
{"Input":"ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;","Output":"and to that party of the three which boasted least animation,"}
{"Input":"between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity,","Output":"of the other all generous attachment."}
{"Input":"You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight","Output":"these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,"}
{"Input":"Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been","Output":"what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind"}
{"Input":"or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage","Output":"in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs"}
{"Input":"Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,","Output":"with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her."}
{"Input":"Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;","Output":"but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten."}
{"Input":"such long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,","Output":"except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear"}
{"Input":"and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been","Output":"so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,"}
{"Input":"that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.","Output":"I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\""}
{"Input":"at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,","Output":"and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;"}
{"Input":"Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.","Output":"Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been"}
{"Input":"conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting","Output":"at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,"}
{"Input":"Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.","Output":"The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;"}
{"Input":"were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,","Output":"excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable"}
{"Input":"cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there","Output":"the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,"}
{"Input":"and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,","Output":"to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something"}
{"Input":"of success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,","Output":"under which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not"}
{"Input":"in his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of","Output":"any claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting"}
{"Input":"accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.","Output":"By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew"}
{"Input":"the number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were","Output":"no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion."}
{"Input":"at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,","Output":"the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society"}
{"Input":"very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;","Output":"nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered"}
{"Input":"leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,","Output":"\"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me"}
{"Input":"to breakfast at his father's.","Output":"Anne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired"}
{"Input":"or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door","Output":"a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;"}
{"Input":"and be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations","Output":"of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions"}
{"Input":"to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.","Output":"It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced","Output":"against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by"}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--","Output":"\"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of","Output":"the whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be"}
{"Input":"\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven's sake go to him.","Output":"I can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,"}
{"Input":"if not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt","Output":"of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,"}
{"Input":"This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short","Output":"in the midst of the Elliot countenance."}
{"Input":"in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation","Output":"to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath"}
{"Input":"it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,","Output":"and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible."}
{"Input":"the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of","Output":"the following autumn."}
{"Input":"\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes","Output":"we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.","Output":"\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds"}
{"Input":"put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time","Output":"which will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath"}
{"Input":"the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret","Output":"that she had said so much, simple as it was."}
{"Input":"to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found","Output":"how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father"}
{"Input":"I have nothing to trouble you with.\"","Output":"\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\""}
{"Input":"It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves","Output":"could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly"}
{"Input":"and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;","Output":"neither was there anything among the other component parts"}
{"Input":"as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon","Output":"passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering"}
{"Input":"Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"","Output":"Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,"}
{"Input":"Chapter 20","Output":"Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest"}
{"Input":"which she grieved to think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few,","Output":"to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;"}
{"Input":"the whole morning!\"","Output":"\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me"}
{"Input":"that every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?","Output":"Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for"}
{"Input":"(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs","Output":"on Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable"}

{"Input":"without her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.","Output":"\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back"}
{"Input":"Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;","Output":"there was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures","Output":"had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,"}
{"Input":"they say again, `Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it.\"","Output":"He got up and moved away."}
{"Input":"from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,","Output":"on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week"}
{"Input":"\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand","Output":"on her arm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you."}
{"Input":"one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,","Output":"that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand"}
{"Input":"given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects,","Output":"which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope"}
{"Input":"from what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne","Output":"from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant"}
{"Input":"a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise","Output":"to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;"}
{"Input":"They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.","Output":"It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,"}
{"Input":"you were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"","Output":"\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling."}
{"Input":"Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,","Output":"she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,"}
{"Input":"to confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people","Output":"to be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free"}
{"Input":"which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.","Output":"It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,"}
{"Input":"with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,","Output":"that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,"}
{"Input":"both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.","Output":"Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:"}
{"Input":"for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,","Output":"if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed."}
{"Input":"nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,","Output":"or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much"}
{"Input":"most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also","Output":"a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,"}
{"Input":"a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names","Output":"in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,"}
{"Input":"very soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"","Output":"\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him."}
{"Input":"anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,","Output":"though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew"}
{"Input":"who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of","Output":"between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder."}
{"Input":"\"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.","Output":"But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady"}
{"Input":"she should like to know who he was.","Output":"They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,"}
{"Input":"She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves","Output":"sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts"}
{"Input":"had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure","Output":"that it would now spread farther."}
{"Input":"Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.","Output":"Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\""}
{"Input":"not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,","Output":"and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself"}
{"Input":"these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,","Output":"comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more"}
{"Input":"\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events","Output":"and calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence"}
{"Input":"but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with","Output":"constant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,"}
{"Input":"bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.","Output":"She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,"}
{"Input":"which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought","Output":"a rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,"}
{"Input":"was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;","Output":"and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,"}
{"Input":"knowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward","Output":"for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was"}
{"Input":"if you will give me materials.\"","Output":"Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,"}
{"Input":"in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain","Output":"as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise"}
{"Input":"that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,","Output":"and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be"}
{"Input":"in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis","Output":"was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced."}
{"Input":"How was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?","Output":"How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,"}
{"Input":"spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that","Output":"the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any"}
{"Input":"better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to","Output":"be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,"}
{"Input":"explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying","Output":"the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which"}
{"Input":"and would call for them in a few minutes.","Output":"Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold"}
{"Input":"He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain","Output":"Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;"}
{"Input":"as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to","Output":"without corresponding indignation."}
{"Input":"\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back","Output":"and change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,"}
{"Input":"had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received","Output":"two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him"}
{"Input":"round the orchestra, of course.\"","Output":"\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me"}
{"Input":"god-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all;","Output":"but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again."}
{"Input":"as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion","Output":"he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money"}
{"Input":"a wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple","Output":"and Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears"}
{"Input":"had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on","Output":"finding her better at night."}
{"Input":"at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;","Output":"sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes"}
{"Input":"Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain","Output":"and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed"}
{"Input":"and vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"","Output":"She checked herself just in time."}
{"Input":"and then he went off to see Edward.  When we came back from Minehead","Output":"he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since."}
{"Input":"more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--","Output":"\"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!"}
{"Input":"slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,","Output":"had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,"}
{"Input":"She could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,","Output":"with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward"}
{"Input":"While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,","Output":"and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,"}
{"Input":"were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),","Output":"there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,"}
{"Input":"and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,","Output":"while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two"}
{"Input":"They had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had","Output":"got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible"}
{"Input":"No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have","Output":"made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely"}
{"Input":"as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful","Output":"if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable"}
{"Input":"and could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:","Output":"Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked"}
{"Input":"which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being","Output":"to be communicated, and everything being to be done together,"}
{"Input":"\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially","Output":"to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;"}
{"Input":"directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out","Output":"on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which"}
{"Input":"particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being","Output":"the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great."}
{"Input":"of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;","Output":"forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with"}
{"Input":"the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain","Output":"on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own,"}
{"Input":"some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing","Output":"the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added"}
{"Input":"carry her gently to the inn.\"","Output":"\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively"}
{"Input":"quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction","Output":"of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would"}
{"Input":"This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,","Output":"who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father"}
{"Input":"Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;","Output":"but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of \"Charles spoils"}
{"Input":"the worth of volumes.\"","Output":"\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,"}
{"Input":"They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa","Output":"seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,"}
{"Input":"were at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way","Output":"along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said."}
{"Input":"the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously","Output":"giving her daughters."}
{"Input":"had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth","Output":"who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that"}
{"Input":"which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints","Output":"of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment"}
{"Input":"\"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.","Output":"Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope"}
{"Input":"of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,","Output":"and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object"}
{"Input":"He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,","Output":"but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace"}
{"Input":"for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards","Output":"fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,"}
{"Input":"Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,","Output":"but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound."}
{"Input":"\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\"","Output":"\"Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,"}
{"Input":"Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of","Output":"the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously"}
{"Input":"But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady","Output":"I am going to talk about.  That young lady, you know, that we have"}
{"Input":"that is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,","Output":"and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice."}
{"Input":"or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and","Output":"comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses"}
{"Input":"\"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred","Output":"in the course of the first evening they spent together:"}
{"Input":"throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,","Output":"but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint"}
{"Input":"take its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,","Output":"if Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always"}
{"Input":"all day long.\"","Output":"Anne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste,"}
{"Input":"of course it is done.\"","Output":"\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness"}
{"Input":"Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine","Output":"you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,"}
{"Input":"how the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable","Output":"to listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\""}
{"Input":"He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,","Output":"had spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot."}
{"Input":"anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed, my dear,","Output":"you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,"}
{"Input":"and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.","Output":"\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,"}
{"Input":"if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;","Output":"her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,"}
{"Input":"They had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away","Output":"all the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated"}
{"Input":"indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,","Output":"or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer"}
{"Input":"for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"","Output":"Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew"}
{"Input":"One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable","Output":"that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some"}
{"Input":"that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known","Output":"so little herself with either of her sisters."}
{"Input":"for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;","Output":"for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,"}
{"Input":"of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least","Output":"the comfort of telling the whole story her own way."}
{"Input":"She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;","Output":"and Bath was to be her home."}
{"Input":"\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\"","Output":"After a moment's pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday,"}
{"Input":"and he saw things as an eldest son himself.","Output":"\"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer."}
{"Input":"cannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.","Output":"I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little."}
{"Input":"and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended","Output":"that her father had judged so well as to give him that"}
{"Input":"that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,","Output":"he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,"}
{"Input":"than leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;","Output":"I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me"}
{"Input":"will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.","Output":"Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\""}
{"Input":"would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might","Output":"be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,"}
{"Input":"the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been","Output":"some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig."}
{"Input":"the commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!","Output":"Now nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party"}
{"Input":"When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park","Output":"for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\""}
{"Input":"they drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;","Output":"but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves"}
{"Input":"She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning","Output":"particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,"}
{"Input":"to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day","Output":"and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,"}
{"Input":"and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently","Output":"more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles."}
{"Input":"how it really was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.)","Output":"\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:"}
{"Input":"could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft","Output":"was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,"}
{"Input":"those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in","Output":"those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,"}
{"Input":"their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as","Output":"attention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way."}
{"Input":"accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth","Output":"should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it"}
{"Input":"She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart","Output":"was too full, her breath too much oppressed."}
{"Input":"over every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties","Output":"to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays."}
{"Input":"for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect","Output":"for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been"}
{"Input":"for the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.","Output":"I have done very little besides sending away some of the large"}
{"Input":"with Mr Elliot's real character.  Though I fully believe that,","Output":"at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,"}
{"Input":"must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.","Output":"I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,"}
{"Input":"and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason","Output":"to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,"}
{"Input":"making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of","Output":"their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed","Output":"former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;"}
{"Input":"and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.","Output":"They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--"}
{"Input":"that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife","Output":"decided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;"}
{"Input":"I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something","Output":"of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!"}
{"Input":"she said she would go home.","Output":"\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,"}
{"Input":"being beyond those of other men.\"","Output":"\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,"}
{"Input":"could place him, was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy","Output":"to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,"}
{"Input":"There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant","Output":"for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,"}
{"Input":"were talked of.","Output":"Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without"}
{"Input":"the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,","Output":"attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;"}
{"Input":"how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.","Output":"After another short silence--"}
{"Input":"Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you","Output":"indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without"}
{"Input":"those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked","Output":"with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which"}
{"Input":"were enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,","Output":"his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all"}
{"Input":"but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties","Output":"of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse"}
{"Input":"for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit","Output":"at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --"}
{"Input":"to give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"","Output":"both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm"}
{"Input":"of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man","Output":"whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,"}
{"Input":"of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her","Output":"extreme agitation."}
{"Input":"in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing","Output":"or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,"}
{"Input":"its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade","Output":"and escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern"}
{"Input":"he looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,","Output":"she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two."}
{"Input":"the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have","Output":"influenced her fate."}
{"Input":"the most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.","Output":"In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared;"}
{"Input":"\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:","Output":"carry her gently to the inn.\""}
{"Input":"Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures","Output":"of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some"}
{"Input":"\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,","Output":"the next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly"}
{"Input":"she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in","Output":"having them accepted."}
{"Input":"I am sure.\"","Output":"She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in."}
{"Input":"cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be","Output":"arguing the matter warmly."}
{"Input":"before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.","Output":"True, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised"}
{"Input":"of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.","Output":"Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were"}
{"Input":"was another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish","Output":"that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth"}
{"Input":"an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,","Output":"seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all"}
{"Input":"who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed","Output":"into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must unquestionably"}
{"Input":"the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,","Output":"the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,"}
{"Input":"of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,","Output":"than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty."}
{"Input":"they have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother","Output":"to part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are"}
{"Input":"my father's next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,","Output":"\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged"}
{"Input":"and made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;","Output":"time will explain.\""}
{"Input":"when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person","Output":"crossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,"}
{"Input":"Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth","Output":"among the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,"}
{"Input":"after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with","Output":"the additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,"}
{"Input":"\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by","Output":"their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as"}
{"Input":"He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him.\"","Output":"\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like him."}
{"Input":"I will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,","Output":"she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!"}
{"Input":"in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about","Output":"in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,"}
{"Input":"with an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything","Output":"relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,"}
{"Input":"upon woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk","Output":"of woman's fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all"}
{"Input":"for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was","Output":"a reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her"}
{"Input":"he was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves","Output":"for the sort of thing.\""}
{"Input":"two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves","Output":"quite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her"}
{"Input":"had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first","Output":"there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance."}
{"Input":"One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth","Output":"being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage"}
{"Input":"of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged","Output":"to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose"}
{"Input":"she will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"","Output":"He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa"}
{"Input":"quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"","Output":"\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,"}
{"Input":"\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences","Output":"which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful."}
{"Input":"Charles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what","Output":"he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that"}
{"Input":"and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,","Output":"pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,"}
{"Input":"of the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.","Output":"I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\""}
{"Input":"whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter","Output":"as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),"}
{"Input":"so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were","Output":"a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her"}
{"Input":"as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot,","Output":"who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect"}
{"Input":"he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;","Output":"the door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,"}
{"Input":"unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,","Output":"that he would let it at all."}
{"Input":"The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.","Output":"They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship"}
{"Input":"would he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think","Output":"of Mr Elliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable."}
{"Input":"in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,","Output":"who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,"}
{"Input":"could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem","Output":"admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing"}
{"Input":"so spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,","Output":"and she then appeared."}
{"Input":"confident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.","Output":"It had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been"}
{"Input":"It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of","Output":"a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature"}
{"Input":"\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had","Output":"the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\""}
{"Input":"to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking","Output":"every moment; \"don't do this,\" and \"don't do that;\"  or that one can"}
{"Input":"of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions","Output":"of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have"}
{"Input":"but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,","Output":"which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath."}

{"Input":"Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had","Output":"such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener"}

{"Input":"It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits","Output":"than Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate"}
{"Input":"and a determined friend, fully requited the services which","Output":"she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife."}
{"Input":"Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,","Output":"in observing--"}

{"Input":"while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two","Output":"so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of"}

{"Input":"as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,","Output":"and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\"","Output":"\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\""}
{"Input":"Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,","Output":"with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes,"}

{"Input":"\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious","Output":"while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,"}
{"Input":"She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,","Output":"either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell"}
{"Input":"Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident","Output":"by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer."}
{"Input":"his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification","Output":"of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,"}
{"Input":"of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to","Output":"have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty."}

{"Input":"the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,","Output":"they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some"}
{"Input":"performance, and total indifference to any other person's,","Output":"gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification"}
{"Input":"at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help","Output":"often saying, `Was this for me?'\""}
{"Input":"\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"","Output":"\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)"}

{"Input":"\"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.","Output":"\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has"}
{"Input":"no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.","Output":"Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could"}
{"Input":"\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.","Output":"Mr Shepherd was all gratitude."}
{"Input":"he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.","Output":"Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified."}
{"Input":"for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;","Output":"and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again."}
{"Input":"however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between","Output":"two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves"}

{"Input":"and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.","Output":"At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\""}
{"Input":"You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,","Output":"perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\""}
{"Input":"and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,","Output":"he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,"}
{"Input":"Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful","Output":"expression which seemed its natural character."}
{"Input":"You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.","Output":"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.\""}

{"Input":"last spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme","Output":"for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;"}
{"Input":"spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was","Output":"not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described"}
{"Input":"he observed, \"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of","Output":"the House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,"}
{"Input":"to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.","Output":"He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,"}
{"Input":"through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.","Output":"How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken"}
{"Input":"some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction","Output":"of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been"}
{"Input":"extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.","Output":"She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;"}
{"Input":"and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable","Output":"or estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,"}
{"Input":"in nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"","Output":"Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him."}
{"Input":"But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;","Output":"and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter"}

{"Input":"from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest","Output":"of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied"}
{"Input":"from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was","Output":"too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together"}

{"Input":"described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,","Output":"is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,"}
{"Input":"as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,","Output":"when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed"}
{"Input":"I shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which","Output":"you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert"}
{"Input":"for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview","Output":"from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her"}
{"Input":"whom alive nobody had cared for.","Output":"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions."}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.","Output":"He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe."}
{"Input":"so capable as Anne.\"","Output":"She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself"}
{"Input":"lost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,","Output":"or what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there."}

{"Input":"always together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.","Output":"He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;"}
{"Input":"Charles laughed again and said, \"Now Mary, you know very well","Output":"how it really was.  It was all your doing,\" (turning to Anne.)"}

{"Input":"the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?","Output":"How can you be so forgetful?\""}
{"Input":"and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,","Output":"which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still"}
{"Input":"While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing","Output":"his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.","Output":"Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had"}
{"Input":"Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like","Output":"wishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself"}
{"Input":"The answer was, \"Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.","Output":"She had rather play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too,"}
{"Input":"in this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was","Output":"a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible"}

{"Input":"in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"","Output":"\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\""}
{"Input":"on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much","Output":"going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings"}
{"Input":"It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,","Output":"my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;"}
{"Input":"and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.","Output":"Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,"}
{"Input":"they are over, and he is safe back again.\"","Output":"The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,"}

{"Input":"then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,","Output":"\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken"}
{"Input":"of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,","Output":"that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,"}
{"Input":"she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,","Output":"and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's"}
{"Input":"Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is","Output":"by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,"}
{"Input":"\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's reflection","Output":"shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;"}

{"Input":"I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"","Output":"Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--"}

{"Input":"Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.","Output":"I knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,"}
{"Input":"to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges","Output":"to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant."}
{"Input":"when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.","Output":"It came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,"}
{"Input":"at all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,","Output":"\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none."}
{"Input":"to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,","Output":"who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of"}
{"Input":"In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,","Output":"\"These rooms ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen"}

{"Input":"to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of","Output":"honesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,"}
{"Input":"this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,","Output":"to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer."}
{"Input":"in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,","Output":"and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,"}
{"Input":"only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance;","Output":"and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,"}

{"Input":"to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such","Output":"certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good."}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family,","Output":"and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,"}
{"Input":"Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.","Output":"\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she."}
{"Input":"and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue","Output":"the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!"}
{"Input":"of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;","Output":"though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike","Output":"appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,"}
{"Input":"I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.","Output":"I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability"}
{"Input":"never become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.","Output":"When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind."}
{"Input":"and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted","Output":"with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her"}
{"Input":"to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,","Output":"the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those"}

{"Input":"Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.","Output":"You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with."}

{"Input":"which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence","Output":"of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison,"}
{"Input":"which is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,","Output":"that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,"}

{"Input":"but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,","Output":"whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from"}

{"Input":"alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently","Output":"from what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blame"}
{"Input":"She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,","Output":"and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about"}

{"Input":"such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing","Output":"in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known","Output":"to design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word"}
{"Input":"piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,","Output":"Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his."}
{"Input":"While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,","Output":"and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance"}
{"Input":"  \"Mary M---.","Output":"\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has"}
{"Input":"but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.","Output":"Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,"}

{"Input":"\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot","Output":"to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;"}
{"Input":"especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.  \"She really left","Output":"nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early"}
{"Input":"which, he hoped, would do her good.  He almost wished she had been","Output":"prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,"}
{"Input":"that she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases","Output":"in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;"}
{"Input":"of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,","Output":"that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal"}
{"Input":"if people thought there was anything to complain of.\"","Output":"Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,"}
{"Input":"to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,","Output":"which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought"}

{"Input":"and the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,","Output":"that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions"}
{"Input":"\"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think","Output":"there was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,"}
{"Input":"towards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,","Output":"with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make"}
{"Input":"should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require","Output":"more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation."}
{"Input":"I was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up","Output":"a great deal of time.\""}
{"Input":"prose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you","Output":"fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think"}
{"Input":"of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger","Output":"to be lessening or not.\""}
{"Input":"at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into","Output":"the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little"}

{"Input":"of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's","Output":"being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through"}
{"Input":"of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged","Output":"friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,"}

{"Input":"\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)","Output":"\"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our"}

{"Input":"which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter","Output":"and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter"}
{"Input":"He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous","Output":"I must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?"}
{"Input":"and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.","Output":"Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,"}
{"Input":"of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,","Output":"last spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme"}
{"Input":"but I shall go to the play.\"","Output":"\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,"}

{"Input":"By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen","Output":"and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,"}
{"Input":"from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.","Output":"I really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation,"}
{"Input":"of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,","Output":"and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became"}
{"Input":"Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,","Output":"hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all"}
{"Input":"in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand","Output":"so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated"}
{"Input":"they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some","Output":"dawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,"}
{"Input":"\"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa","Output":"bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal"}
{"Input":"was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter's;","Output":"but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--"}
{"Input":"from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,","Output":"for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,"}
{"Input":"as the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people","Output":"Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,"}
{"Input":"I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,","Output":"to do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,"}
{"Input":"cried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.","Output":"I could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where"}
{"Input":"with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite","Output":"unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,"}
{"Input":"They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something","Output":"of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,","Output":"looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence."}
{"Input":"understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,","Output":"led by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by"}

{"Input":"It was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew","Output":"that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be"}
{"Input":"This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.","Output":"She understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not"}
{"Input":"Here Anne spoke--","Output":"\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least"}
{"Input":"the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,","Output":"he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions"}

{"Input":"breeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--","Output":"\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,"}
{"Input":"and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,","Output":"never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety"}
{"Input":"whether there may not have been one person more my enemy","Output":"even than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned"}
{"Input":"it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health,","Output":"by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,"}
{"Input":"she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,","Output":"and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back"}
{"Input":"what I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive","Output":"in the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity"}
{"Input":"as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?","Output":"Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, dear ma'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,","Output":"an engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing"}
{"Input":"as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,","Output":"there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--"}
{"Input":"he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place","Output":"she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him"}

{"Input":"her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;","Output":"and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,"}
{"Input":"no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth","Output":"from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne."}
{"Input":"but as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given","Output":"her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it"}
{"Input":"in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home","Output":"for half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine"}
{"Input":"in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton","Output":"with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were"}
{"Input":"with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.","Output":"Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,"}
{"Input":"or swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not","Output":"finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;"}
{"Input":"they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,","Output":"and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;"}
{"Input":"imitation of nature: --","Output":"\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise"}

{"Input":"Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,","Output":"whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children"}
{"Input":"\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing","Output":"in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose"}
{"Input":"at the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,","Output":"with no more interest than his.\""}
{"Input":"much in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,","Output":"and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many"}

{"Input":"Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--","Output":"Charles Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other"}
{"Input":"strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter","Output":"Elliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom"}
{"Input":"Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,","Output":"was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all"}
{"Input":"of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.","Output":"To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name"}
{"Input":"to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen","Output":"in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself"}
{"Input":"which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,","Output":"to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,"}
{"Input":"or anything so certainly as embarrassed.","Output":"After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again."}
{"Input":"accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,","Output":"and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner,"}
{"Input":"who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.","Output":"It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,"}
{"Input":"to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,","Output":"the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying"}
{"Input":"and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and","Output":"an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,"}
{"Input":"under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest","Output":"and best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,"}
{"Input":"of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?","Output":"Surely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me."}
{"Input":"had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been","Output":"particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,"}
{"Input":"any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been","Output":"long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,"}
{"Input":"to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process","Output":"in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring"}
{"Input":"to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,","Output":"and she too little."}
{"Input":"Charles laughed.","Output":"\"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is"}
{"Input":"and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart","Output":"could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had"}
{"Input":"upon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on","Output":"before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling."}
{"Input":"which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be","Output":"an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" admitted Charles, \"I do not know that he ever does, in a general","Output":"way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly."}
{"Input":"with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself","Output":"to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,"}
{"Input":"tasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,","Output":"no waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,"}
{"Input":"She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in","Output":"the public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,"}
{"Input":"Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.","Output":"\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters"}
{"Input":"No, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband","Output":"could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose"}
{"Input":"what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered","Output":"in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,"}
{"Input":"before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.","Output":"Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in"}
{"Input":"anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years","Output":"had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still"}
{"Input":"by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.","Output":"This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet"}
{"Input":"waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of,","Output":"\"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,"}
{"Input":"the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.","Output":"It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves"}
{"Input":"which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much","Output":"I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,"}
{"Input":"so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery","Output":"from the awful impression of its being dissolved."}
{"Input":"died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,","Output":"and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend"}

{"Input":"Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described","Output":"the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this"}

{"Input":"but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity","Output":"of character were irresistible."}
{"Input":"solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)","Output":"could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,"}
{"Input":"seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk","Output":"for her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went."}
{"Input":"added--","Output":"\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,"}
