{"Input":"In the mean time, till all these alterations could","Output":"be made from the savings of an income of five hundred"}

{"Input":"so much vigour as when they first came to Barton,","Output":"at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future."}
{"Input":"much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.","Output":"Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she,"}
{"Input":"to say half that was to be said of the past, the present,","Output":"and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in"}

{"Input":"Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time","Output":"even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained"}
{"Input":"up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or suffice","Output":"to say half that was to be said of the past, the present,"}
{"Input":"These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal","Output":"of his love for her sister, affected her very much."}

{"Input":"and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon,","Output":"was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival."}

{"Input":"The reason alleged was their determined resolution","Output":"of not leaving their mother at that time of the year."}
