{"Input":"Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been","Output":"flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly"}
{"Input":"impudent way.  Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not","Output":"always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it."}
{"Input":"That is what she writes about.  That is the reason of her writing out","Output":"of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have"}

{"Input":"and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening","Output":"her lips."}
{"Input":"memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,","Output":"it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form"}
{"Input":"she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed","Output":"on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.  What is right to be done","Output":"cannot be done too soon.  And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;"}
{"Input":"the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,","Output":"there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,"}
{"Input":"and his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be","Output":"laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing"}
{"Input":"Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal","Output":"of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than"}

{"Input":"whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,","Output":"I shall certainly wish him well.\""}
{"Input":"hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather","Output":"said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew"}

{"Input":"attached to him.  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.","Output":"He never wished to attach me.  It was merely a blind to conceal"}
{"Input":"assisted the temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was","Output":"continually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,"}
{"Input":"and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most","Output":"perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was"}

{"Input":"\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us","Output":"understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake."}
{"Input":"She could really say nothing.--\"You are silent,\" he cried,","Output":"with great animation; \"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\""}

{"Input":"None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth","Output":"and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man"}
{"Input":"a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;","Output":"and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,"}
{"Input":"was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,","Output":"and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering"}
{"Input":"not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;","Output":"for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is"}
{"Input":"The persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the Eltons,","Output":"it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--"}
{"Input":"&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a","Output":"wretched suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper,"}
{"Input":"she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--","Output":"but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious"}
{"Input":"that it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought","Output":"when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if"}
{"Input":"I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.\"","Output":"\"Our poor ball must be quite given up.\""}

{"Input":"\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,","Output":"are unjust to Harriet.  Harriet's claims to marry well are not"}
{"Input":"\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.","Output":"\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\""}
{"Input":"She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,","Output":"taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more"}
{"Input":"ever seen.  Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all","Output":"the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,"}
{"Input":"was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,","Output":"and making no other comment than that \"all young people would have"}

{"Input":"had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received","Output":"with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that"}
{"Input":"I, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible","Output":"ingratitude in me to be severe on them?\""}
{"Input":"It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.  We never see any","Output":"thing of it on our club-nights.\""}

{"Input":"but there was great joy.  Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see","Output":"him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.  John Knightley"}

{"Input":"his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.","Output":"The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,"}
{"Input":"residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.","Output":"I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;"}

{"Input":"faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness.\"","Output":"\"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,"}
{"Input":"he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not","Output":"suffer it to be so, you know.  He has a wife and family to maintain,"}
{"Input":"mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.  They had music;","Output":"Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily"}
{"Input":"he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely","Output":"followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,"}
{"Input":"as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof","Output":"among others that he had not always lived in the best society,"}
{"Input":"at this time was the very thing to be desired.  She admired","Output":"him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit"}
{"Input":"\"Then pray stay at Richmond.\"","Output":"\"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.  I can never bear to think"}
{"Input":"with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,","Output":"than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all"}
{"Input":"warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.","Output":"She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for"}
{"Input":"was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,","Output":"and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear"}
{"Input":"from it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every","Output":"other recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her."}
{"Input":"These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.","Output":"It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank"}
{"Input":"or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct","Output":"is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--"}
{"Input":"imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor","Output":"with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be"}
{"Input":"She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told","Output":"her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping"}
{"Input":"Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.","Output":"He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping"}
{"Input":"her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache","Output":"she has.  When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel"}
{"Input":"own family to study from.  There is my father--another of my","Output":"father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,"}
{"Input":"\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing.  So far from","Output":"having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error"}
{"Input":"gaining strength.  With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,","Output":"there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;"}
{"Input":"which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\"","Output":"\"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large"}
{"Input":"\"And cannot you call me `George' now?\"","Output":"\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'"}
{"Input":"When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"","Output":"\"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\""}
{"Input":"Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a","Output":"talent in favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are."}

{"Input":"by this time.\"","Output":"\"Has your son been with you, then?\""}
{"Input":"that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second","Output":"time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley"}
{"Input":"have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the","Output":"particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,"}
{"Input":"His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was","Output":"not opposed.  All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one"}
{"Input":"could have told him in return.","Output":"As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;"}
{"Input":"it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not","Output":"be increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his."}
{"Input":"without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in","Output":"the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably"}
{"Input":"Miss Bates?  How unlucky!  Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind","Output":"might have strengthened yours.\""}
{"Input":"it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said","Output":"about it.  She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their"}
{"Input":"And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not","Output":"know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.  You have drawn"}
{"Input":"and when Mrs. Weston ended with, \"We have not yet had the letter","Output":"we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,\""}

{"Input":"The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is","Output":"most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.  I never saw such"}
{"Input":"There was no occasion to press the matter farther.  The conviction","Output":"seemed real; he looked as if he felt it.  She said no more,"}
{"Input":"in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original","Output":"author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might"}
{"Input":"than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.","Output":"It will be the only difference.\""}
{"Input":"\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"","Output":"\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow"}
{"Input":"very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not","Output":"fond of dining out.\""}
{"Input":"her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.","Output":"He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her."}
{"Input":"useful now.\"","Output":"\"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"consented to a private engagement?\"","Output":"\"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed"}
{"Input":"and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been","Output":"impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her"}
{"Input":"it unwholesome.\"","Output":"\"Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley presently, \"I have a piece of news for you."}
{"Input":"and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness","Output":"which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather"}
{"Input":"\"Yes,\" said Jane, \"we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\"","Output":"\"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door"}
{"Input":"hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,","Output":"his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat."}
{"Input":"habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,","Output":"in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;"}
{"Input":"but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away","Output":"from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from"}
{"Input":"best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no;","Output":"we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,"}
{"Input":"if I would.  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used;","Output":"I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be"}
{"Input":"escape me which I should not.  I am not like Jane; I wish I were.","Output":"I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world."}
{"Input":"sufficiently before them.","Output":"Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though"}
{"Input":"nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to","Output":"take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease."}
{"Input":"I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.  I am","Output":"thwarted in every thing material.  I do not consider myself at all"}
{"Input":"him hotter.\"  In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;","Output":"and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.  Emma returned"}
{"Input":"\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr. Knightley","Output":"presently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now"}
{"Input":"help suspecting him.  I think he is just the person to do it,","Output":"even without being in love.\""}
{"Input":"so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--","Output":"What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--"}
{"Input":"of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell","Output":"about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word"}
{"Input":"but to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,","Output":"like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it"}
{"Input":"but that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,","Output":"if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,"}
{"Input":"could really judge.  She appeared to me to play well, that is,","Output":"with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--"}
{"Input":"comfortably settled.  Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,","Output":"and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought"}
{"Input":"her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a","Output":"sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's"}
{"Input":"Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.\"","Output":"The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton."}
{"Input":"which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.  She was","Output":"too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:"}
{"Input":"so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have","Output":"all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations"}
{"Input":"blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings","Output":"of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield."}
{"Input":"met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,","Output":"he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas"}
{"Input":"but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us","Output":"about it, for Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as"}
{"Input":"looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects","Output":"in view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,"}
{"Input":"a great many, and now you have not one left.  We really are so shocked!","Output":"Mrs. Hodges may well be angry.  William Larkins mentioned it here."}
{"Input":"she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.","Output":"Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage."}
{"Input":"whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.  She suspected","Output":"that it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered"}
{"Input":"and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--","Output":"\"You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn"}
{"Input":"there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that,","Output":"till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace"}
{"Input":"The ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant","Output":"attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body"}
{"Input":"As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater","Output":"kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly"}
{"Input":"with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--","Output":"\"Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--"}
{"Input":"who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,","Output":"but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,"}
{"Input":"\"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one","Output":"of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;"}
{"Input":"by Harriet's having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,","Output":"with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one"}
{"Input":"at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow","Output":"myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe"}
{"Input":"she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.","Output":"Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be"}
{"Input":"and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might","Output":"be safely left to itself.  She, therefore, said no more for some time."}
{"Input":"good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.\"","Output":"\"Have you indeed no idea?\" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice."}
{"Input":"He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays","Output":"left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give"}
{"Input":"but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,","Output":"I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed"}
{"Input":"and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.","Output":"He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--"}
{"Input":"said Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen","Output":"with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using"}
{"Input":"was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,","Output":"that he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;"}
{"Input":"He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--","Output":"He heard her declare that she had never loved him.  Frank Churchill's"}
{"Input":"to herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable","Output":"or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on."}
{"Input":"if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.","Output":"I know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any"}
{"Input":"over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,","Output":"in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,"}
{"Input":"they never occurred but for her own convenience.","Output":"Mrs. Weston added, \"that he could only allow himself time to"}
{"Input":"Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive","Output":"than such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma"}
{"Input":"\"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.","Output":"Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--"}
{"Input":"not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,","Output":"with an air of grave reflection,"}
{"Input":"the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.","Output":"You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,"}
{"Input":"Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence.","Output":"They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;"}
{"Input":"any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest","Output":"old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this"}
{"Input":"air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any","Output":"of mama's children ever were.  Here is my sketch of the fourth,"}

{"Input":"a common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that","Output":"the mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued,"}
{"Input":"there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could","Output":"not quite acquit her.  But \"she could never get acquainted with her:"}
{"Input":"Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances","Output":"of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not","Output":"only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly"}
{"Input":"his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether","Output":"objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit"}
{"Input":"going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive","Output":"this morning.  He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been"}
{"Input":"on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course","Output":"of the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon"}
{"Input":"becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance","Output":"of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two."}
{"Input":"I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you","Output":"all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,"}
{"Input":"all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,","Output":"with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to"}

{"Input":"\"I hope she does.  I would have her understand me.  I am not","Output":"in the least ashamed of my meaning.\""}
{"Input":"I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father","Output":"from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem"}

{"Input":"\"I have made a most wretched discovery,\" said he, after a short pause.--","Output":"\"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.  I never knew"}
{"Input":"seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal","Output":"to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters"}
{"Input":"visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,","Output":"to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again."}
{"Input":"quite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,","Output":"never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield"}
{"Input":"with them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--","Output":"Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_."}
{"Input":"The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.","Output":"He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the"}

{"Input":"it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon","Output":"after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering","Output":"by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted"}
{"Input":"Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--","Output":"merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the"}

{"Input":"ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_,","Output":"and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\""}
{"Input":"At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.","Output":"\"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?\" asked Mrs. Ford.--"}
{"Input":"but she would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me,","Output":"which I then thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing"}

{"Input":"She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening","Output":"the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention,"}

{"Input":"Bates than,","Output":"\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?  I beg your pardon.  I did not see"}

{"Input":"if you were married.\"","Output":"Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,"}
{"Input":"few difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London;","Output":"the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste"}

{"Input":"In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax","Output":"with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense"}

{"Input":"and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--","Output":"no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it"}
{"Input":"\"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such","Output":"a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining."}
{"Input":"\"I certainly must,\" said she.  \"This sensation of listlessness,","Output":"weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,"}

{"Input":"\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and","Output":"Mrs. Weston doat upon her.\""}
{"Input":"She did it all herself.  Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--","Output":"No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--"}
{"Input":"at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage,","Output":"but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons."}
{"Input":"Consider from how partial a quarter your information came.","Output":"I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends"}
{"Input":"He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been","Output":"unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due"}

{"Input":"of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \"Rather he than I!\"--","Output":"But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor Knightley!"}
{"Input":"and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must","Output":"be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given"}
{"Input":"\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness","Output":"indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen"}

{"Input":"walking away.","Output":"After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse"}
{"Input":"there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:","Output":"The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,"}

{"Input":"was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her","Output":"opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young"}
{"Input":"the young people will find a way.\"  But here there was nothing to be","Output":"shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.  It was all right,"}
{"Input":"such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--","Output":"She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward"}
{"Input":"Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence","Output":"of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,"}
{"Input":"\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you.","Output":"I should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you--"}
{"Input":"it is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.--","Output":"I thought I knew him.\""}
{"Input":"from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty","Output":"and acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not"}
{"Input":"time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.","Output":"But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,"}
{"Input":"those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults,","Output":"and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right"}
{"Input":"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.","Output":"The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;"}
{"Input":"and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never","Output":"been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character."}
{"Input":"but coming back, said,","Output":"\"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.  I have never seen"}
{"Input":"and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public","Output":"enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile"}
{"Input":"good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels","Output":"about Emma, Mr. Knightley.\""}
{"Input":"Let no name ever pass our lips.  We were very wrong before;","Output":"we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there"}
{"Input":"which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--","Output":"\"I do believe,\" she continued, \"this is the most troublesome parish"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, very soon.  He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;","Output":"he asked my pardon and said no more.  Cole does not want to be wiser"}
{"Input":"behaved charmingly.  Every body was punctual, every body in their","Output":"best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no;"}
{"Input":"and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.","Output":"Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses"}
{"Input":"Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,","Output":"that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,"}
{"Input":"in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking","Output":"to disappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that"}
{"Input":"pale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so","Output":"much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma"}
{"Input":"and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon.\"","Output":"This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.  When once"}
{"Input":"I found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as","Output":"if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,"}
{"Input":"chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him","Output":"to her assistance at this critical moment.  The pleasantness"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility","Output":"of any other change, he could not agree to.  He had been thinking"}
{"Input":"It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,","Output":"and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it."}
{"Input":"she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.","Output":"\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while"}
{"Input":"a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he","Output":"could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment"}
{"Input":"is increasing, and you mix more with it.  A little while ago,","Output":"every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;"}
{"Input":"What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house","Output":"from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope"}
{"Input":"but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are","Output":"most unfortunately blended in her.\""}
{"Input":"will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.","Output":"Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had"}
{"Input":"She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.  She had","Output":"reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was"}
{"Input":"`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very","Output":"kind neighbour!'  And then fly off, through half a sentence,"}
{"Input":"little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed","Output":"between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,"}
{"Input":"as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly","Output":"in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing."}
{"Input":"I never saw any thing equal to it.\"","Output":"\"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose"}
{"Input":"\"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,","Output":"my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there."}
{"Input":"Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient","Output":"for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself."}
{"Input":"not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it","Output":"all easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea"}
{"Input":"The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid","Output":"of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet"}
{"Input":"at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem","Output":"to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.","Output":"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be"}
{"Input":"friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led","Output":"her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to"}
{"Input":"Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend","Output":"them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.\""}
{"Input":"shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--","Output":"and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse"}
{"Input":"\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being","Output":"very much attached to this man.  She might never have thought of him"}
{"Input":"of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,","Output":"\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_"}
{"Input":"Ladies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally","Output":"so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were","Output":"sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a"}
{"Input":"corner were these words--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,","Output":"as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.  Pray make"}
{"Input":"\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\"","Output":"This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--","Output":"not like Mr. Elton.  Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,"}
{"Input":"once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--","Output":"she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it"}
{"Input":"themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming","Output":"back prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and"}
{"Input":"\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them","Output":"both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be."}
{"Input":"but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy","Output":"of your affection, as you think me already.  Had he said any thing"}
{"Input":"with me.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished","Output":"my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,"}
{"Input":"Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,","Output":"for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have"}
{"Input":"your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,","Output":"it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself"}
{"Input":"understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought","Output":"extravagant in my terms.\""}
{"Input":"\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless","Output":"for herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,"}
{"Input":"for Emma's services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,","Output":"as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home"}
{"Input":"but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.","Output":"He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great"}
{"Input":"on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;","Output":"their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma"}
{"Input":"the young farmer out of Harriet's head.  She thought it would","Output":"be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,"}
{"Input":"allowed his attentions.  Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--","Output":"I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them"}
{"Input":"did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take","Output":"him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing"}
{"Input":"She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,","Output":"that nothing might prevent her.  It was not unlikely, she thought,"}
{"Input":"to act.  You and I need not be afraid.  If _we_ set the example,","Output":"many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not"}
{"Input":"had prevailed.  Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us","Output":"of it when we got home?  I forget where we had been walking to--"}
{"Input":"according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of","Output":"his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,"}
{"Input":"eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,","Output":"and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door."}
{"Input":"been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:","Output":"he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,"}
{"Input":"It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  Mrs. Weston had, of course,","Output":"formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing"}
{"Input":"such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt","Output":"to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.\""}
{"Input":"\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you","Output":"are not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are."}
{"Input":"\"Frank was here in February for a fortnight.\"","Output":"\"So I remember to have heard.  He will find an _addition_ to the"}
{"Input":"Every body knows what is due to _you_.\"","Output":"\"It will not do,\" whispered Frank to Emma; \"they are most"}
{"Input":"her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.","Output":"Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as"}
{"Input":"forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard","Output":"the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able"}
{"Input":"\"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think","Output":"you have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.\""}
{"Input":"not endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation","Output":"and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to"}
{"Input":"\"For shame, Emma!  Do not mimic her.  You divert me against","Output":"my conscience.  And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would"}
{"Input":"renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,","Output":"and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for."}
{"Input":"of them know of the engagement?\"","Output":"Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush."}
{"Input":"air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,","Output":"though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties"}
{"Input":"can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.\"","Output":"\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\""}
{"Input":"as to give Emma time only to say farther,","Output":"\"Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability"}
{"Input":"Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.","Output":"Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill"}
{"Input":"thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,","Output":"sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had"}
{"Input":"glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned","Output":"her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony."}
{"Input":"that could be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\"","Output":"She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully"}
{"Input":"to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing","Output":"him never.  Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen"}
{"Input":"To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they","Output":"were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account,"}
{"Input":"alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;","Output":"and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question."}
{"Input":"she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the","Output":"right a hundred times.\""}
{"Input":"\"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,","Output":"that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon"}
{"Input":"\"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.","Output":"But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,"}
{"Input":"Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy","Output":"made her irresolute what else to say."}
{"Input":"a very few minutes settled the business.","Output":"Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,"}
{"Input":"and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well","Output":"educated as me.  But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,"}
{"Input":"and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could","Output":"not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--"}
{"Input":"practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.","Output":"For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could"}
{"Input":"fruit thoroughly wholesome.  We have apple-dumplings, however,","Output":"very often.  Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,"}
{"Input":"a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied","Output":"their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,"}
{"Input":"does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days","Output":"in the week.  And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down"}
{"Input":"chosen her.  But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives","Output":"attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\""}
{"Input":"\"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley","Output":"to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--"}
{"Input":"Escape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room","Output":"where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about"}
{"Input":"for me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners","Output":"to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable."}
{"Input":"should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.","Output":"It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being"}
{"Input":"Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the","Output":"warmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--"}
{"Input":"lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse","Output":"for his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen"}
{"Input":"\"is he--is he a tall man?\"","Output":"\"Who shall answer that question?\" cried Emma.  \"My father would"}
{"Input":"tolerably convincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able","Output":"to talk about it more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing"}
{"Input":"something else.  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,","Output":"and turning to Emma, said,"}
{"Input":"But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.","Output":"I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.  I do not by any"}
{"Input":"to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,","Output":"before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,"}
{"Input":"Can it be Neptune?","Output":"      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!"}
{"Input":"every party breaks up, the better.\"","Output":"\"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles."}
{"Input":"was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist","Output":"the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,"}
{"Input":"believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--","Output":"yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar"}
{"Input":"As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.","Output":"Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that"}
{"Input":"her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'","Output":"departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--","Output":"and it was, \"How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--"}
{"Input":"resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--","Output":"But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself"}
{"Input":"were all reasonable.  We must look to her one fault, and remember","Output":"that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,"}
{"Input":"The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event","Output":"that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been"}
{"Input":"the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once","Output":"got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--"}
{"Input":"or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their","Output":"first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the"}

{"Input":"had once told her it was because she saw in her the really","Output":"accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;"}
{"Input":"and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!","Output":"I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.  I could not go away"}
{"Input":"amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,","Output":"fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;"}
{"Input":"his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own.","Output":"He sat musing a little while, and then said,"}
{"Input":"little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,","Output":"which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself"}
{"Input":"\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\"","Output":"replied Isabella:  \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young"}
{"Input":"be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;","Output":"he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;"}
{"Input":"of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she","Output":"plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance."}
{"Input":"of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her","Output":"general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.  As a daughter,"}
{"Input":"\"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light","Output":"this morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,"}
{"Input":"He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,","Output":"I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask"}
{"Input":"or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;","Output":"but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say"}
{"Input":"that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any","Output":"means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.\""}
{"Input":"She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;","Output":"she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him"}
{"Input":"and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again,","Output":"with any necessity, or even any power of speech."}

{"Input":"and ashamed we were.  `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must,","Output":"and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'\""}
{"Input":"and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,","Output":"without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss."}
{"Input":"Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I","Output":"did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we","Output":"are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\""}
{"Input":"And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he","Output":"would hear her in any thing else.  The listeners were amused;"}

{"Input":"was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,","Output":"and meant only for her."}
{"Input":"\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\"","Output":"observed Mr. John Knightley coolly.  \"But you need not imagine"}

{"Input":"whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,","Output":"and that one is--\""}
{"Input":"a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.","Output":"Still, however, he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,"}
{"Input":"was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston","Output":"as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw"}
{"Input":"\"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,\" said Mr. Weston, \"is, that","Output":"Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the"}

{"Input":"enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.  I believe","Output":"you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--"}
{"Input":"\"Do you think so?\" replied he.  \"I cannot agree with you.","Output":"It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature."}
{"Input":"in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was","Output":"particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;"}
{"Input":"\"Well,\" said he, in a deliberating manner, \"for five minutes, perhaps.\"","Output":"\"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;"}
{"Input":"There was no bearing such an \"always;\" and to break through her","Output":"dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--"}
{"Input":"knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--","Output":"for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,"}
{"Input":"I happened to meet him in the street.  Not that I had any doubt before--","Output":"I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple."}

{"Input":"quitted the room,--\"I have been as good as my word.  She has not the","Output":"least idea.\""}
{"Input":"well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations","Output":"to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;"}
{"Input":"but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,","Output":"it must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts"}
{"Input":"enchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds","Output":"themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.\""}
{"Input":"with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--","Output":"(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we"}

{"Input":"\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.","Output":"Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,"}
{"Input":"Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled","Output":"nor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint."}
{"Input":"Why do you make a doubt of it?\"","Output":"\"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,"}
{"Input":"\"That fellow,\" said he, indignantly, \"thinks of nothing but shewing","Output":"off his own voice.  This must not be.\"  And touching Miss Bates,"}

{"Input":"\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining","Output":"me to be Mr. Elton's object?\""}
{"Input":"Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the","Output":"discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel","Output":"with herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than"}

{"Input":"\"But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.","Output":"Surprizes are foolish things.  The pleasure is not enhanced, and the"}

{"Input":"the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--","Output":"She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously"}
{"Input":"without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.--","Output":"I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,"}

{"Input":"as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must","Output":"compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his"}

{"Input":"So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see","Output":"if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill."}
{"Input":"\"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;","Output":"widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;"}
{"Input":"she is better than handsome!\"  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield","Output":"with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much"}
{"Input":"My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being","Output":"beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that,"}
{"Input":"      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.","Output":"Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better.  A man must be very much"}

{"Input":"consideration.  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,","Output":"when invited to come, would be ingratitude.  It must not be:"}
{"Input":"and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter","Output":"what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect"}
{"Input":"but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.  The apples","Output":"themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;"}
{"Input":"A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded","Output":"by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle."}
{"Input":"not one of us.","Output":"\"Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\" added her husband, with a sort of"}

{"Input":"And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis","Output":"of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct"}
{"Input":"but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,","Output":"and that it had not been in vain.  She thought there was an air"}
{"Input":"the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional","Output":"agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--"}
{"Input":"William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same","Output":"sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,"}
{"Input":"\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,","Output":"before one decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston."}
{"Input":"to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,","Output":"after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of"}
{"Input":"Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning","Output":"among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking"}
{"Input":"\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came","Output":"to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it."}
{"Input":"how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,","Output":"first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,"}

{"Input":"some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get","Output":"back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,"}

{"Input":"at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet","Output":"him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--"}
{"Input":"her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there","Output":"been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions"}

{"Input":"from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it","Output":"possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation."}
{"Input":"Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.","Output":"The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;"}
{"Input":"The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured","Output":"of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--"}
{"Input":"and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,","Output":"she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on"}
{"Input":"and even when particulars were given and families described, he was","Output":"still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture"}
{"Input":"in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak","Output":"every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her"}
{"Input":"but said only, coolly,","Output":"\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\""}
{"Input":"all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually","Output":"blinded than myself--except that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my"}

{"Input":"Poor girl!  I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston","Output":"came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about"}
{"Input":"she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.","Output":"She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare"}
{"Input":"settled that Jane should go.  Quite a surprize to me!  I had not","Output":"the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,"}
{"Input":"You must have heard every thing to be sure.  `Can I do any thing","Output":"for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!"}
{"Input":"\"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?\"","Output":"\"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have"}
{"Input":"prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known","Output":"at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking"}

{"Input":"of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley","Output":"saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;"}
{"Input":"But it is his way.  One man's style must not be the rule of another's.","Output":"We will not be severe.\""}
{"Input":"to Emma.","Output":"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her"}
{"Input":"a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,","Output":"the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the"}
{"Input":"is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--","Output":"how it might all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there"}
{"Input":"\"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think","Output":"there will.\""}
{"Input":"and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.","Output":"She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself"}
{"Input":"and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast","Output":"as she could, and took shelter at Ford's.\"--Ford's was the principal"}
{"Input":"something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;","Output":"but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he"}
{"Input":"passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,","Output":"she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain"}
{"Input":"\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston,","Output":"\"ever since September:  every letter has been full of it;"}
{"Input":"\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away.  \"And now we","Output":"shall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been"}
{"Input":"\"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore","Output":"why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?"}
{"Input":"how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\"","Output":"\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh."}
{"Input":"The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage","Output":"was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh!\" cried Emma, \"I know there is not a better creature in the world:","Output":"but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are"}
{"Input":"\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,","Output":"contemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered"}

{"Input":"that he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;","Output":"and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest"}
{"Input":"concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy","Output":"her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went"}
{"Input":"upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree.","Output":"You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you"}
{"Input":"thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,","Output":"\"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own"}
{"Input":"But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,","Output":"she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least"}
{"Input":"descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.","Output":"\"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible,"}
{"Input":"He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,","Output":"till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse"}
{"Input":"use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes","Output":"much depressed.  And as to its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I"}
{"Input":"and I have never been able to get it out again.  The more I think","Output":"of it, the more probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match"}
{"Input":"been your own master.  You are the worst judge in the world,","Output":"Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.  You do not know"}
{"Input":"as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,","Output":"and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having"}
{"Input":"What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,","Output":"was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having"}
{"Input":"was the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited","Output":"to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums"}
{"Input":"for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing","Output":"his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,"}
{"Input":"for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.\"","Output":"His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,"}
{"Input":"\"Dating from three o'clock yesterday.  My perpetual influence","Output":"could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much"}
{"Input":"if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself","Output":"every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where"}
{"Input":"would receive the constant addition of that person's company","Output":"whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,"}

{"Input":"of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;","Output":"and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think"}
{"Input":"Emma was most sincerely interested.  Her heart had been long growing","Output":"kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted"}
{"Input":"so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.","Output":"It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of"}
{"Input":"say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,","Output":"but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention"}
{"Input":"not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash","Output":"had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately"}
{"Input":"on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.","Output":"But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's"}

{"Input":"of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,","Output":"on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished"}
{"Input":"temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;","Output":"but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured"}
{"Input":"was all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he","Output":"could never believe other people to be different from himself."}
{"Input":"and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter","Output":"reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--"}
{"Input":"mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour","Output":"of such exercise for his patient.  The answer was only in this"}
{"Input":"by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,","Output":"from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing."}
{"Input":"It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking","Output":"from it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every"}

{"Input":"not rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,","Output":"Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand"}
{"Input":"\"I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in","Output":"your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,"}
{"Input":"to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.\"","Output":"But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly"}
{"Input":"\"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,","Output":"that there can be no use in canvassing it.  We shall only be making"}

{"Input":"He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,","Output":"with a smile, observed, \"Humph! a fine complimentary opening:"}

{"Input":"was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally","Output":"addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being"}
{"Input":"If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,","Output":"of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting"}
{"Input":"and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.","Output":"They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it"}
{"Input":"Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.  From Frank Churchill's face,","Output":"where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,"}
{"Input":"the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,","Output":"and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was,"}

{"Input":"unheard by her father,","Output":"\"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it"}
{"Input":"the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton","Output":"cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the"}

{"Input":"Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his","Output":"friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber."}
{"Input":"considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.","Output":"She hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof."}
{"Input":"He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of","Output":"the day.  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,"}
{"Input":"Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on","Output":"no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.  \"Indeed, the truth was,"}
{"Input":"the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been","Output":"there repeatedly.\""}

{"Input":"which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve","Output":"to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--"}
{"Input":"There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will","Output":"do for themselves."}
{"Input":"\"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John","Output":"Knightley, hearing his own name."}
{"Input":"he would not be sufferable.  On the contrary, I think a young man","Output":"might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model."}
{"Input":"she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance","Output":"of every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out"}
{"Input":"The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,","Output":"but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.\""}

{"Input":"\"Yes; my father is to join me here:  we shall walk back together,","Output":"and I must be off immediately.  I am almost afraid that every moment"}

{"Input":"to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.","Output":"Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he"}
{"Input":"now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way","Output":"to Kingston.  He has passed you very often.\""}
{"Input":"\"Poor girl!\" said Emma again.  \"She loves him then excessively,","Output":"I suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could"}
{"Input":"may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,","Output":"that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness"}

{"Input":"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill","Output":"opinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct."}

{"Input":"Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance","Output":"was as steady as her words."}

{"Input":"Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.","Output":"\"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about."}
{"Input":"she cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill,","Output":"`Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--"}

{"Input":"before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any","Output":"thing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly."}
{"Input":"What did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.--","Output":"She said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him"}
{"Input":"her to stay longer with us.  She and the children might stay very well.\"","Output":"\"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,"}
{"Input":"you mention.  Perry says that colds have been very general,","Output":"but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November."}

{"Input":"\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is","Output":"nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no"}
{"Input":"The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through","Output":"before her arrival.  Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long"}

{"Input":"The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.","Output":"It was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a"}

{"Input":"It is a certainty.  Receive it on my judgment.  It is a sort","Output":"of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon"}
{"Input":"Time passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London","Output":"would be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking"}

{"Input":"and there are several.","Output":"    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,"}
{"Input":"Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,","Output":"not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash"}

{"Input":"in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard","Output":"for every old acquaintance."}
{"Input":"\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\"","Output":"\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no.  You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.","Output":"There is no comparison between them.  Miss Campbell always was"}
{"Input":"all thinking of?\"","Output":"\"Oh! no, no\"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--"}
{"Input":"think about them--and she would not think about them any longer\"","Output":"but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour"}
{"Input":"and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations","Output":"were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \"my"}
{"Input":"intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,","Output":"on Isabella's letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain"}
{"Input":"never came out again.  My mother often talks of your good-nature.","Output":"Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--"}
{"Input":"flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed","Output":"must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away."}
{"Input":"with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate","Output":"her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before."}
{"Input":"should be.\"","Output":"\"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.  He sat"}
{"Input":"\"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball.  My father","Output":"depends on it.  Do not forget your engagement.\""}

{"Input":"the world!  He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from","Output":"Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was"}
{"Input":"honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,","Output":"her composure was odious.  She had been particularly unwell, however,"}
{"Input":"to him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates","Output":"was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,"}
{"Input":"you know.  Surry is the garden of England.\"","Output":"\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction."}
{"Input":"character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,","Output":"when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought"}
{"Input":"but it was just too late.  He had turned away, and the horses were","Output":"in motion.  She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,"}
{"Input":"One of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.","Output":"He had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed"}
{"Input":"desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting","Output":"the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return."}
{"Input":"as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her","Output":"mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.  They had music;"}
{"Input":"wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.","Output":"\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he;"}
{"Input":"Fairfax's complexion.  \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she","Output":"would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was"}
{"Input":"\"Proof indeed!\" said Emma, highly amused.--\"Mr. Dixon is very musical,","Output":"is he?  We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,"}
{"Input":"At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too","Output":"much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings."}
{"Input":"\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.","Output":"He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made,"}
{"Input":"\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she;","Output":"\"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;"}
{"Input":"from intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he","Output":"was no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation,"}
{"Input":"I do not pretend to be a wit.  I have a great deal of vivacity","Output":"in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak"}
{"Input":"can be to see her.  Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,","Output":"because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one"}
{"Input":"Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss","Output":"Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the"}

{"Input":"great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.","Output":"She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action"}
{"Input":"\"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"","Output":"Another song, however, was soon begged for.  \"One more;--they would"}

{"Input":"It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;","Output":"highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers."}
{"Input":"At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes","Output":"for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side."}
{"Input":"she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene","Output":"as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,"}
{"Input":"The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,","Output":"in their different divisions, arrived.  Emma watched the entree of her"}
{"Input":"we do not think alike.\"  He paused a moment, again smiling,","Output":"with his eyes fixed on her face.  \"Does nothing occur to you?--"}
{"Input":"of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm","Output":"of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,"}
{"Input":"deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for","Output":"such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved"}
{"Input":"by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--","Output":"Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;"}

{"Input":"Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.  We have nothing clever to say--","Output":"not one of us."}
{"Input":"It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it","Output":"possible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude"}
{"Input":"It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--","Output":"and the air so bad!\""}
{"Input":"hold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.","Output":"There, it is done.  I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)"}
{"Input":"but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\"","Output":"The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency."}
{"Input":"though I might have staid with you till the next morning,","Output":"merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.  Even then,"}
{"Input":"every body invites their friends about them, and people think little","Output":"of even the worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend's house once"}
{"Input":"reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--","Output":"a letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;"}
{"Input":"it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce","Output":"Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe"}
{"Input":"would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger","Output":"with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts"}
{"Input":"man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew","Output":"tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather"}
{"Input":"in twenty minutes.\"","Output":"\"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone."}
{"Input":"time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week","Output":"in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him."}
{"Input":"                              \"Yours ever,","Output":"                                                       \"A. W.\""}

{"Input":"His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice","Output":"of sentiment as he answered."}
{"Input":"he would make a good husband.  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.","Output":"She was in no hurry at all."}
{"Input":"the idea.\"","Output":"\"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me."}
{"Input":"\"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!\" she found something else must be done.","Output":"They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates."}
{"Input":"are not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.","Output":"If any thing, you are too attentive.  The muffin last night--if it"}

{"Input":"I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince","Output":"me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\""}
{"Input":"And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you","Output":"cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time"}
{"Input":"against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the","Output":"formation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again,"}
{"Input":"and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you","Output":"that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.\""}
{"Input":"They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so","Output":"impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,"}
{"Input":"as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place","Output":"the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy."}
{"Input":"the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of","Output":"imaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--"}
{"Input":"during their conversation, that though he must go to London,","Output":"it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,"}
{"Input":"pressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work directly,","Output":"and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts"}
{"Input":"that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.","Output":"Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case."}
{"Input":"from town.  Jane came back delighted yesterday.  Thank ye,","Output":"the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;"}
{"Input":"they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly","Output":"noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all"}
{"Input":"suppose him such an unnatural creature?\"","Output":"\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting"}
{"Input":"for herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,","Output":"and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated"}
{"Input":"in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent","Output":"her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not"}
{"Input":"words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.","Output":"The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for"}

{"Input":"\"We consider our Hartfield pork,\" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it","Output":"certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I"}
{"Input":"_She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of","Output":"concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;"}
{"Input":"had undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter,","Output":"giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,"}
{"Input":"or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take","Output":"the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one."}
{"Input":"man without the greatest compassion.  To be constantly living","Output":"with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.  It is what we"}
{"Input":"he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;","Output":"but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence"}
{"Input":"always wanted all round the country.  I suppose there is not a man","Output":"in such practice anywhere.  But then there is not so clever a man"}
{"Input":"And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the","Output":"subject directly."}
{"Input":"\"I went only to the post-office,\" said she, \"and reached home","Output":"before the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch"}
{"Input":"my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.","Output":"I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might"}
{"Input":"may be the greater.  But I must be more in want of a friend,","Output":"or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take"}
{"Input":"\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand,","Output":"and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one"}
{"Input":"Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;","Output":"and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,"}
{"Input":"sure William Larkins will not like it.  You must get his consent","Output":"before you ask mine.\""}
{"Input":"you shall not, indeed.\"","Output":"It was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love"}
{"Input":"\"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who","Output":"could really judge.  She appeared to me to play well, that is,"}
{"Input":"Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.  Her ideas","Output":"only varied as to the how much.  At first, she thought it was a good deal;"}
{"Input":"the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so,","Output":"there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,"}

{"Input":"\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'","Output":"I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,"}
{"Input":"any thing I can express.  After such behaviour, as I have witnessed","Output":"during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I"}
{"Input":"extreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you","Output":"my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet"}
{"Input":"so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his","Output":"friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--"}
{"Input":"than you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come","Output":"down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--"}
{"Input":"who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,","Output":"so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so"}
{"Input":"which I shall always know how to value.\"","Output":"Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude."}
{"Input":"on her mother's account.  After some attempts, therefore, to be","Output":"permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,"}
{"Input":"She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, \"Well, Harriet,","Output":"whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so\"--and thought"}
{"Input":"with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah!  Miss Taylor, if you had","Output":"not married, you would have staid at home with me.\""}
{"Input":"thing that home affords.\"","Output":"Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,"}
{"Input":"but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and","Output":"tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--"}
{"Input":"on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.  I do not recommend matrimony","Output":"at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.\""}
{"Input":"grateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit _him_,","Output":"Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame."}
{"Input":"his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;","Output":"but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly"}

{"Input":"was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.","Output":"The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;"}
{"Input":"she did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between","Output":"her and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,"}
{"Input":"more useful on such occasions.  It is not that I am without the wish;","Output":"but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James"}
{"Input":"his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit","Output":"for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms."}
{"Input":"\"I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\" said she.--","Output":"\"In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives,"}

{"Input":"and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.","Output":"He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc."}
{"Input":"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater","Output":"pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted"}
