{"Input":"Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and","Output":"perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some"}

{"Input":"looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me","Output":"whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'"}
{"Input":"'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was","Output":"walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face."}
