{"Input":"by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl.  On the police interfering,","Output":"the young woman threw back the shawl, and all recognized"}
{"Input":"     \"Oh, don't you see?\" she cried; \"the whole picture is made for that--","Output":"the place is planned for it.  Champion put John in a little house"}
{"Input":"     \"I rather wonder,\" said Father Brown, \"that there are so few people","Output":"about the beach, when this big fight is coming on after all."}
{"Input":"I shall be following myself in a minute or two.\"","Output":"     But Calhoun Kidd, having finished a milk and soda, betook himself"}
{"Input":"     \"I have not told her,\" said the doctor gruffly--, \"but here come","Output":"the police.\""}
{"Input":"John Boulnois was a big, slow-moving man with a massive head,","Output":"partly grey and partly bald, and blunt, burly features."}
{"Input":"the dapper dryness of the young American; but something in his pencil","Output":"and open notebook, and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye,"}
{"Input":"     There was a second of stillness in the room, and then everyone","Output":"with one accord burst out laughing.  As they did so the figure"}
{"Input":"     \"Yes,\" groaned the Admiral; \"by one of those brutal accidents","Output":"on which are built all the lying mythologies of mankind,"}
{"Input":"     \"But surely,\" insisted Flambeau, \"it might point pretty straight","Output":"at something or other.\""}
{"Input":"     The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of","Output":"its violet-blue, like the vein of a frozen finger.  For miles and miles,"}
{"Input":"     They had emerged on a small square, brilliantly lighted,","Output":"of which the principal building was gay with gilding, gaudy with posters,"}
{"Input":"and that was the great thing.","Output":"     \"I rather wonder,\" said Father Brown, \"that there are so few people"}
{"Input":"afterwards and the machine, sir, is right.\"","Output":"     He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement."}
{"Input":"     Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical gestures,","Output":"and with a passion I think at least partisan.  I was quite conscious"}
{"Input":"I found a milk-can--and the man with the twisted nose.  The milk-can","Output":"told me the servants were all out; for, of course, Arthur,"}
{"Input":"     \"I think so,\" was the equally grave reply.","Output":"     \"Then go over there and offer yourself,\" said the priest:"}
{"Input":"as if on his heart, but really on the little bottle of poison;","Output":"and a great light came into his face like the light of the revelation"}
{"Input":"as to various chemical improvements.  He had lately even discovered","Output":"a noiseless explosive, the secret of which the Government was"}
{"Input":"into the dark and driving river.","Output":"     \"You can do no more, I fear,\" said Brown in a voice cold with pain."}
{"Input":"answered the girl, still breathing hard from her rush.  \"That man Glass","Output":"has been with him again; I heard them talking through the door quite plain."}
{"Input":"     \"A burglar with a bad cold,\" observed Father Brown, \"that might","Output":"assist you to trace him in the neighbourhood.\""}
{"Input":"\"Well, well, what a queer story!  What a queer way of killing a man;","Output":"but I suppose it was the only one possible.  But to think of hate"}
{"Input":"but it was the only part of him that moved like a living thing.","Output":"He was clad in his full white and yellow uniform, as to receive his"}
{"Input":"into the inside with a pocket lens.  \"How to explain the absence","Output":"of Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass's hat?  For Mr Glass is not a"}
{"Input":"the precise truth.  His phrase that the cook was starting presently","Output":"was fulfilled to the letter, for the cook came out, pulling his gloves on,"}
{"Input":"about it in the street?\"","Output":"     \"I will tell you why I do!\" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd."}
{"Input":"     Father Brown shook his head, like a murderer of much riper experience.","Output":"\"So Flambeau said,\" he replied, with a sigh.  \"But consider."}
{"Input":"of the little priest of the restaurant; he alleged merely","Output":"that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland."}
{"Input":"from the old black top hat on his head to the solid black boots","Output":"on his feet.  In spite of these he walked straight into the sea"}
{"Input":"He mixed up these Roman halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs","Output":"family in the same stiff, idolatrous way as his father before him."}
{"Input":"than I am a genuine courier.  I am only a bundle of masks,","Output":"and you can't fight a duel with that.\"  And he laughed with boyish pleasure"}
{"Input":"I heard his delicate, detestable voice appealing to me over my shoulder,","Output":"until at last, when we had crested the sand-hills, Philip's patience"}
{"Input":"with over-work, and when he began to recover, his friend Flambeau","Output":"had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with Sir Cecil Fanshaw,"}
{"Input":"the bank from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play.","Output":"He had been run through the body."}
{"Input":"and munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted","Output":"a tumbler of cold water.  His talk, however, was exuberant."}
{"Input":"I don't like about the Duke's wig--the colour.\"","Output":"     \"I don't think I understand,\" I answered."}
{"Input":"     \"Why, she wants to marry him,\" cried Father Brown, sitting up eagerly.","Output":"\"That is just the awful complication.\""}
{"Input":"to relieve the monotony for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such","Output":"a position.  But I am so rattled with more dreadful things that I can"}
{"Input":"     Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time, with an expression","Output":"between perplexity and amusement; and then, rising from the table;"}
{"Input":"\"I sat the man in the ill-fitting clothes in a comfortable chair,","Output":"and simply wrote words on a blackboard; and the machine simply"}
{"Input":"too much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet.\"","Output":"     \"But time for what?\" asked Dr Hood, who had been studying"}
{"Input":"     \"Had the flowers got long stalks?\" asked Father Brown.","Output":"     Flambeau stared at him.  \"What an odd person you are!\" he said."}
{"Input":"he had the gun.  I meant no harm to him or any man but one.","Output":"I am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim's Pond--O.R.'  A man must have used"}
{"Input":"Instantly his two servants slipped out of the low-browed cavern","Output":"and supported him.  They wore dull-black gowns like his own,"}
{"Input":"     Then, before I could collect my scattered senses, he added","Output":"equally quietly, but with an air of regularizing things:"}
{"Input":"that he is economical, that he is more or less wealthy, and that","Output":"he has a secret.  Now, surely it is obvious that there are"}
{"Input":"to the soft sand-hills, where he can be victor in a mere sham-fight.","Output":"If he'd struck amid rocks and sea, he might have hurt his ally.\""}
{"Input":"     \"Of course the superficial, on reflection,\" said Flambeau,","Output":"\"would think first of this Australian brother who's been"}
{"Input":"Saturday.--Yours, E. NUTT.","Output":"     This elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word;"}
{"Input":"to see protegees, humble friends, that sort of thing, or you'd have","Output":"gone through into the parlour...and you couldn't have come in because"}
{"Input":"could be called inferior.  As private persons both were handsome,","Output":"capable and popular.  As public persons, both were in the first public rank."}
{"Input":"But we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor-cab.\"","Output":"     Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept"}
{"Input":"expression \"Adieu\" should be obliterated from all the French classics,","Output":"and a slight fine imposed for its use in private life.  \"Then,\" he said,"}
{"Input":"as Flambeau protested:  \"Yes, yes, I know about the bullet.","Output":"Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash.  I know it doesn't sound"}
{"Input":"with the final night-fall.  It seemed to me that something like a snail","Output":"was on the outside of the window-pane.  But when I stared harder,"}
{"Input":"towards the prisoner's door.  Did he see anything in the passage?","Output":"Yes; he saw something in the passage."}
{"Input":"\"but it is not outside ordinary science or natural law for a family","Output":"to have some deformity frequently reappearing--such as one ear bigger"}
{"Input":"lifted his round face and said:  \"What do you mean?\"","Output":"     The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger-sword"}
{"Input":"cried Flambeau.  \"The note is utterly wrong about the facts.","Output":"And innocent or guilty, Dr Hirsch knew all about the facts.\""}
{"Input":"shaking his head; \"and the mistake of Italy.  In the sixteenth century","Output":"we Tuscans made the morning:  we had the newest steel, the newest carving,"}
{"Input":"     His ruminating eye roved to the girl's light canvas sleeve,","Output":"round the wrist of which ran a very slight thread of artistic pattern,"}
{"Input":"personalities may be pardoned.  I may tell you without offence","Output":"of a way in which you will do more good than by helping the gendarmes,"}
{"Input":"but I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale:","Output":"that the Other Man (or whatever it is) crawls out every night from the"}
{"Input":"IV. The Man in the Passage","Output":"TWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage"}
{"Input":"ready for wine on a side-table, but a third lay smashed","Output":"in a star of crystal upon the carpet.  A few feet from it lay"}
{"Input":"had a banshee; and, now I come to think of it, it has comforted me","Output":"in many a cold hour.\""}
{"Input":"\"I suppose we'd better follow him outside,\" he said.  \"I don't want","Output":"any more--shall we say, sneezing?\""}
{"Input":"he saw what no one else saw--the black figure of Dr Oman standing","Output":"on the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room.  Before he could"}
{"Input":"     During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet","Output":"and was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes.  \"By hell,"}
{"Input":"There is no curse in it at all.\"","Output":"     Father Brown smiled.  \"In that case,\" he said, \"there can't be"}
{"Input":"to arrest Isidore Bruno upon a charge of murder, brought against him","Output":"by his furious opponent.  The idea that the great national hero of the hour"}
{"Input":"and entrances, for meeting friends or avoiding them.","Output":"     The two men in question were certainly two such friends,"}
{"Input":"     \"Don't get up, Mr Boulnois,\" said the priest in his pleasant,","Output":"prosaic way.  \"I shan't interrupt you a moment.  I fear I break in on"}
{"Input":"     \"I haven't a notion,\" answered Father Brown.  \"I want you","Output":"to find out; I ask it as a favour.  He went down there\"--and he jerked"}
{"Input":"TWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage","Output":"running along the side of the Apollo Theatre in the Adelphi."}
{"Input":"only a shadow and a voice.  He heard also the water broken by","Output":"the paddles of a canoe; the girl's voice giving orders,"}
{"Input":"completely in black, with a rubicund, even apoplectic visage,","Output":"but a rather bald and rather bothered brow.  Looking at him again,"}
{"Input":"     And indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most","Output":"from their leader and father in philosophy.  Dr Hirsch,"}
{"Input":"     Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist.  \"By Jove!\" he cried;","Output":"\"and so had that girl!\""}
{"Input":"     The big librarian had buried his big bald brow in his big red hands,","Output":"like a man trying to think out his duty.  \"No,\" he groaned."}
{"Input":"     Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder.","Output":"\"Why, what has happened, Maggie?\" he said."}
{"Input":"when he looked at Heinrich but pointed at Paul, and said,","Output":"`You have not told him...' and was soon afterwards incapable of speech."}
{"Input":"Don't let's talk about the old Admiral.  Don't let's talk about anything.","Output":"It's enough to say that whenever this tower, with its pitch and resin-wood,"}
{"Input":"giving his name as Oscar Rian.  He was only temporarily detained","Output":"for some comparatively trivial assault; but he gave everyone the impression"}

{"Input":"looking up at it with a curiosity that had something rather odd about it,","Output":"his head a little on one side, like a bird's.  It was the conventional,"}
{"Input":"which was the revolver in his hand.","Output":"     \"Cray!\" exclaimed the Major, staring at him; \"did you fire that shot?\""}
{"Input":"There was a full moon, as I walked to the window; I could have seen a bird","Output":"on the bare battlement, or a sail on the horizon.  What I did see"}
{"Input":"the green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the","Output":"elusive individuality of an elfin queen.  But when personally confronted"}
{"Input":"Once more a few sentences were inaudible, but they could hear him say:","Output":"\"To my friends--I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual,"}
{"Input":"and more luxurious than it looked at first, and was quite a different kind","Output":"of place from a porter's lodge.  A dog-kennel and a beehive stood outside,"}

{"Input":"think it out.  I sat at the drawing-room window looking on to the garden,","Output":"which still glowed with the last full evening light.  But I was too"}
{"Input":"with sunshine, and saw Colonel Cray's tall figure bent almost double,","Output":"minutely examining the condition of gravel and grass.  While the Major"}

{"Input":"     Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a spring had","Output":"flung him from it.  \"I'm damned if I'll stand any more of this!\""}
{"Input":"and told him to call again in a few days, when I had thought it out.","Output":"He went off sulking, but more sheepishly than I had expected--"}
{"Input":"Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about","Output":"in the grass."}
{"Input":"noticed it now.","Output":"     \"The poor lady's dress was torn,\" said the witness,"}
{"Input":"with a working face; then moved shakily back into the dressing-room again,","Output":"and sat down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs."}

{"Input":"     \"Real madmen,\" explained Father Brown, \"always encourage their","Output":"own morbidity.  They never strive against it.  But you are trying"}
{"Input":"blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn, before I will take it","Output":"as a sign that I am to shed it.\""}
{"Input":"like Byron with a Roman nose, those black curls already grizzled--","Output":"he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion."}
{"Input":"and many have suffered from it.  They know there are none who have","Output":"suffered from it as I have.\"  And with that he crushed a piece of"}
{"Input":"You don't do justice to the climbing and aspiring power of our","Output":"more remarkable citizens.  You see a good-looking grey-haired man"}
{"Input":"with broad, blunt visages and blinking eyes.  For the first time","Output":"something troubled the Prince, but his courage and diplomatic sense"}
{"Input":"\"What's that house over there?\" he asked.","Output":"     Following his finger, Flambeau saw for the first time the corners"}
{"Input":"\"Excuse me if I detain you a few minutes.  As I told you,","Output":"I have no staff--\" And he went towards the black windows of"}

{"Input":"I suggest it should occur without further delay.  I suggest that","Output":"Mr Harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds"}
{"Input":"I was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night.","Output":"A window was thrown up in one of the upper floors, but just round"}
{"Input":"and another had set fire to a church full of children, and so on.","Output":"     Some of the tales, indeed, are not fit for public print--,"}
{"Input":"of a man remembering somebody's name.  He knew now what it was","Output":"that was neither soda-water nor the snorting of a dog."}
{"Input":"I resume the points of my proclamation, so soon to be published","Output":"to all Italy.  The third item is that of ransom.  I am asking"}
{"Input":"is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses.","Output":"There are plenty of instances; but you couldn't begin with a better one"}
{"Input":"     Father Brown smiled.  \"In that case,\" he said, \"there can't be","Output":"any objection to my sleeping in your delightful summer-house.\""}
{"Input":"but quite indistinctly, indeed not at all, as regards the details","Output":"inside the outline.  The passage is of such length that anyone in"}

{"Input":"I'd seen it so slowly.","Output":"     \"The man or monster I'd sent away was standing quite still"}
{"Input":"blood on the brass now.  And so we shall never know whether there was","Output":"blood on it before.\""}
{"Input":"four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story.","Output":"Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that?"}
{"Input":"     \"`I fear we have not met,' he said, `since that awful cannonade","Output":"in which your poor brother died.'"}
{"Input":"in consultation with the lodge-keeper.  But the little priest","Output":"only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine, and at last"}
