{"Input":"Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts ","Output":"Assured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest "}
{"Input":"So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete ","Output":"And Ida known, thence on the snowy top "}
{"Input":"The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim ","Output":"Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds, "}
{"Input":"Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce, ","Output":"From beds of raging fire to starve in ice "}
{"Input":"That day I oft remember, when from sleep ","Output":"I first awaked, and found myself reposed "}
{"Input":"Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered ","Output":"Opening their various colours, and made gay "}
{"Input":"Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut ","Output":"Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood, "}
{"Input":"Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die. ","Output":"She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold "}
{"Input":"Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear ","Output":"Of their great Sultan waving to direct "}
{"Input":"Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death! ","Output":"What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned "}
{"Input":"Peace and composure, and with open breast ","Output":"Stand ready to receive them, if they like "}
{"Input":"'And thou moon in the vale of Aialon, ","Output":"'Till Israel overcome! so call the third "}
{"Input":"Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss, ","Output":"Thus far at least recovered, hath much more "}
{"Input":"Above the flight of Pegasean wing! ","Output":"The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou "}
{"Input":"Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, ","Output":"Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! "}
{"Input":"Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice ","Output":"Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste "}
{"Input":"Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed, ","Output":"Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose "}
{"Input":"Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day, ","Output":"Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls "}
{"Input":"Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged ","Output":"Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms "}
{"Input":"Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed, ","Output":"War terrify them inexpert, and fear "}
{"Input":"To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests ","Output":"Or violence, he of their wicked ways "}
{"Input":"Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return, ","Output":"Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed! "}
{"Input":"Kindled through agitation to a flame, ","Output":"Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, "}
{"Input":"Repeated; she to him as oft engaged ","Output":"To be returned by noon amid the bower, "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"All these his works so wonderous he ordained, ","Output":"Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim "}
{"Input":"Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host ","Output":"Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, "}
{"Input":"To trust thee from my side; imagined wise, ","Output":"Constant, mature, proof against all assaults; "}
{"Input":"Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit, ","Output":"That with exhilarating vapour bland "}
{"Input":"Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain ","Output":"Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright, "}
{"Input":"That glory never shall his wrath or might ","Output":"Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace "}
{"Input":"Pains only in child-bearing were foretold, ","Output":"And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy, "}
{"Input":"Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed, ","Output":"And, in embraces forcible and foul "}
{"Input":"Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven ","Output":"Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived "}
{"Input":"Let in these wasteful furies, who impute ","Output":"Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell "}
{"Input":"Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round ","Output":"About her glowed, oft stooping to support "}
{"Input":"Another side, umbrageous grots and caves ","Output":"Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine "}
{"Input":"At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared ","Output":"The work as of a kingly palace-gate, "}
{"Input":"He with a crew, whom like ambition joins ","Output":"With him or under him to tyrannize, "}
{"Input":"Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air, ","Output":"No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray "}
{"Input":"And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled ","Output":"Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these "}
{"Input":"Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb, ","Output":"Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown, "}
{"Input":"Then of their session ended they bid cry ","Output":"With trumpet's regal sound the great result: "}
{"Input":"Such place Eternal Justice has prepared ","Output":"For those rebellious; here their prison ordained "}
{"Input":"They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; ","Output":"But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more, "}
{"Input":"Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature: ","Output":"This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive "}
{"Input":"Homeward returning.  High in front advanced, ","Output":"The brandished sword of God before them blazed, "}
{"Input":"My part of evil only, each day's lot ","Output":"Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed "}
{"Input":"Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; ","Output":"Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades, "}
{"Input":"How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives, ","Output":"And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, "}
{"Input":"Of day and night; which needs not thy belief, ","Output":"If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day "}
{"Input":"Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss. ","Output":"Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume, "}
{"Input":"To see that none thence issued forth a spy, ","Output":"Or enemy, while God was in his work; "}
{"Input":"Like his, and colour serpentine, may show ","Output":"Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee "}
{"Input":"Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined ","Output":"Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered "}
{"Input":"Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee ","Output":"Abundantly his gifts hath also poured "}
{"Input":"Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.-- ","Output":"This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help, "}
{"Input":"The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven, ","Output":"Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe, "}
{"Input":"Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail ","Output":"Of iron globes; which, on the victor host "}
{"Input":"His travelled steps: far distant he descries ","Output":"Ascending by degrees magnificent "}
{"Input":"His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life. ","Output":"So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate, "}
{"Input":"Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth ","Output":"After soft showers; and sweet the coming on "}
{"Input":"His own invented torments. But perhaps ","Output":"The way seems difficult, and steep to scale "}
{"Input":"Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue ","Output":"The soul of man, or passion in him move. "}
{"Input":"Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep ","Output":"Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. "}
{"Input":"Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest ","Output":"Us happy, and without love no happiness. "}
{"Input":"All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand, ","Output":"Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, "}
{"Input":"Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives ","Output":"In other worlds, and happier seat provides "}
{"Input":"Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone ","Output":"Above them all th' Archangel: but his face "}
{"Input":"Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps ","Output":"Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb "}
{"Input":"In all things else delight indeed, but such ","Output":"As, used or not, works in the mind no change, "}
{"Input":"To guide them in their journey, and remove ","Output":"Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues: "}
{"Input":"By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom ","Output":"The second, both for piety renowned "}
{"Input":"With lowliness majestick from her seat, ","Output":"And grace that won who saw to wish her stay, "}
{"Input":"But opposite in levelled west was set, ","Output":"His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light "}
{"Input":"To the reception of their matter, act; ","Output":"Not to the extent of their own sphere.  But say "}
{"Input":"Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept, ","Output":"Though not of woman born; compassion quelled "}
{"Input":"In darkness, and with dangers compassed round, ","Output":"And solitude; yet not alone, while thou "}
{"Input":"Under amazement of their hideous change. ","Output":"He called so loud that all the hollow deep "}
{"Input":"Down from a sky of jasper lighted now ","Output":"In Paradise, and on a hill made halt; "}
{"Input":"Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise; ","Output":"Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed, "}
{"Input":"Came like a deluge on the South, and spread ","Output":"Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands. "}
{"Input":"Above his brethren; to himself assuming ","Output":"Authority usurped, from God not given: "}
{"Input":"And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled ","Output":"O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host "}
{"Input":"With what is punished; whence these raging fires ","Output":"Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames. "}
{"Input":"But up, and enter now into full bliss? ","Output":"So having said, a while he stood, expecting "}
{"Input":"Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault ","Output":"Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought "}
{"Input":"A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed ","Output":"Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense, "}
{"Input":"Into the burning lake their baleful streams-- ","Output":"Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; "}
{"Input":"Happiness in his power left free to will, ","Output":"Left to his own free will, his will though free, "}
{"Input":"More than enough; at least on her bestowed ","Output":"Too much of ornament, in outward show "}
{"Input":"Not more almighty to resist our might ","Output":"Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. "}
{"Input":"As not of power at once; nor odds appeared ","Output":"In might or swift prevention:  But the sword "}
{"Input":"Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned, ","Output":"To Michael thus his humble words addressed. "}
{"Input":"What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send ","Output":"Against us from about his throne, and judged "}
{"Input":"Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, ","Output":"And from their ivory port the Cherubim, "}
{"Input":"Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal ","Output":"To Adam what shall come in future days, "}
{"Input":"With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn ","Output":"True patience, and to temper joy with fear "}
{"Input":"Build in her loveliest, and create an awe ","Output":"About her, as a guard angelick placed. "}
{"Input":"The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown ","Output":"Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod. "}
{"Input":"No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue ","Output":"The errour now, which is become my crime, "}
{"Input":"Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume, ","Output":"Or emptiness, or fond impertinence: "}
{"Input":"From under Heaven; the hills to their supply ","Output":"Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, "}
{"Input":"Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw ","Output":"The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh "}
{"Input":"By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved, ","Output":"To expedite your glorious march; but I "}
{"Input":"Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed ","Output":"Labour, as to debar us when we need "}
{"Input":"Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:-- ","Output":"  \"Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven "}
{"Input":"And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap. ","Output":"There they their fill of love and love's disport "}
{"Input":"As may express them best; though what if Earth ","Output":"Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein "}
{"Input":"Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath, ","Output":"That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow, "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. ","Output":"Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, "}
{"Input":"New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build: ","Output":"Others came single; he, who, to be deemed "}
{"Input":"On every conscience; laws which none shall find ","Output":"Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within "}
{"Input":"For him who sits above, and laughs the while ","Output":"At thee, ordained his drudge to execute "}
{"Input":"Thy hatred for this misery befallen; ","Output":"On me already lost, me than thyself "}
{"Input":"Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, ","Output":"And charming symphonies, attached the heart "}
{"Input":"But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee ","Output":"Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they "}
{"Input":"More miserable!  Both have sinned;but thou ","Output":"Against God only; I against God and thee; "}
{"Input":"Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comest ","Output":"Before thy fellows, ambitious to win "}
{"Input":"Disporting, till the amorous bird of night ","Output":"Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star "}
{"Input":"They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms, ","Output":"Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast; "}
{"Input":"Far more than great or high; because in thee ","Output":"Love hath abounded more than glory abounds; "}
{"Input":"Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast, ","Output":"Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear? "}
{"Input":"Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim; ","Output":"But longer in this Paradise to dwell "}
{"Input":"For in possession such, not only of right, ","Output":"I call ye, and declare ye now; returned "}
{"Input":"The pain of absence from thy sight.  But strange ","Output":"Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear: "}
{"Input":"As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce ","Output":"Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat "}
{"Input":"Lest Paradise a receptacle prove ","Output":"To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey; "}
{"Input":"To peaceful counsels, and the settled state ","Output":"Of order, how in safety best we may "}
{"Input":"Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware ","Output":"He swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal "}
{"Input":"To entertain our Angel-guest, as he ","Output":"Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Thee next they sang of all creation first, ","Output":"Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, "}
{"Input":"Though after sleepless night; for see!the morn, ","Output":"All unconcerned with our unrest, begins "}
{"Input":"Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed: ","Output":"Your fear itself of death removes the fear. "}
{"Input":"This essence to incarnate and imbrute, ","Output":"That to the highth of Deity aspired! "}
{"Input":"Certain to undergo like doom:  If death ","Output":"Consort with thee, death is to me as life; "}
{"Input":"There is, said Michael, if thou well observe ","Output":"The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught, "}
{"Input":"Prefer, and piety to God, though then ","Output":"To thee not visible, when I alone "}
{"Input":"Embowelled with outrageous noise the air, ","Output":"And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul "}
{"Input":"Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm. ","Output":"Was I to have never parted from thy side? "}
{"Input":"Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire ","Output":"Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith "}
{"Input":"Like instrument to plague the sons of men ","Output":"For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent. "}
{"Input":"Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down; ","Output":"Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus "}
{"Input":"Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night, ","Output":"With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon, "}
{"Input":"Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant, ","Output":"His worshippers?  He knows that in the day "}
{"Input":"My dissolution.  Michael replied. ","Output":"Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest "}
{"Input":"Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven ","Output":"To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe "}
{"Input":"Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star, ","Output":"On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate, "}
{"Input":"And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, ","Output":"Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. "}
{"Input":"Since higher I fall short, on him who next ","Output":"Provokes my envy, this new favourite "}
{"Input":"Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze ","Output":"Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged "}
{"Input":"By me the Promised Seed shall all restore. ","Output":"So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard "}
{"Input":"Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce ","Output":"Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, "}
{"Input":"Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given, ","Output":"Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed "}
{"Input":"Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran ","Output":"With supple joints, as lively vigour led: "}
{"Input":"Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed ","Output":"Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon "}
{"Input":"To luxury and riot, feast and dance; ","Output":"Marrying or prostituting, as befel, "}
{"Input":"In height or depth, still first and last will reign ","Output":"Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part "}
{"Input":"Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled ","Output":"Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons "}
{"Input":"Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: ","Output":"So dear I love him, that with him all deaths "}
{"Input":"Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, ","Output":"All but within those banks, where rivers now "}
{"Input":"To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet ","Output":"Mortality my sentence, and be earth "}
{"Input":"Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend ","Output":"With victory, triumphing through the air "}
{"Input":"But what will not ambition and revenge ","Output":"Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low "}
{"Input":"When he who rules is worthiest, and excels ","Output":"Them whom he governs.  This is servitude, "}
{"Input":"Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence ","Output":"Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse, "}
{"Input":"Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest: ","Output":"Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God "}
{"Input":"Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye ","Output":"Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart "}
{"Input":"Soon banded; others from the dawning hills ","Output":"Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour, "}
{"Input":"Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws ","Output":"Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees "}
{"Input":"Whoever judged, the worst on me must light, ","Output":"When time shall be; for so I undertook "}
{"Input":"Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. ","Output":"O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet "}
{"Input":"Misery, uncreated till the crime ","Output":"Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled "}
{"Input":"To a reproachful life, and cursed death; ","Output":"Proclaiming life to all who shall believe "}
{"Input":"So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. ","Output":"Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand "}
{"Input":"Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined ","Output":"His loss; but chiefly to find here observed "}
{"Input":"The prison of his ryranny who reigns ","Output":"By our delay? No! let us rather choose, "}
{"Input":"And hazard in the glorious enterprise ","Output":"Joined with me once, now misery hath joined "}
{"Input":"So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began ","Output":"To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll "}
{"Input":"Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood; ","Output":"For never but once more was wither like "}
{"Input":"So well converse, nor with the ox the ape; ","Output":"Worse then can man with beast, and least of all. "}
{"Input":"Betokening peace from God, and covenant new. ","Output":"Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad, "}
{"Input":"If this be our condition, thus to dwell ","Output":"In narrow circuit straitened by a foe, "}
{"Input":"This universe, and all created things: ","Output":"One foot he centered, and the other turned "}
{"Input":"That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined ","Output":"Of union irresistible, moved on "}
{"Input":"Doubted his empire--that were low indeed; ","Output":"That were an ignominy and shame beneath "}
{"Input":"We ours for change delectable, not need;) ","Output":"Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn "}
{"Input":"A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold ","Output":"And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear, "}
{"Input":"Collecting all his might, dilated stood, ","Output":"Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: "}
{"Input":"At sight of all this world beheld so fair. ","Output":"Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood "}
{"Input":"Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever ","Output":"With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind "}
{"Input":"Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each ","Output":"In other's countenance read his own dismay, "}
{"Input":"Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, ","Output":"As to a superiour nature bowing low, "}
{"Input":"With clang despised the ground, under a cloud ","Output":"In prospect; there the eagle and the stork "}
{"Input":"Cannot but by annihilating die; ","Output":"Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound "}
{"Input":"His captive multitude. For he, to be sure, ","Output":"In height or depth, still first and last will reign "}
{"Input":"In that aspect, and still that distance keeps ","Output":"Till night; then in the east her turn she shines, "}
{"Input":"Men also, and by his suggestion taught, ","Output":"Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands "}
{"Input":"And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone, ","Output":"Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself; "}
{"Input":"This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes) ","Output":"Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest; "}
{"Input":" Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee ","Output":" Freely put off, and for him lastly die "}
{"Input":"But they, or under ground, or circuit wide ","Output":"With serpent errour wandering, found their way, "}
{"Input":"Till I, in Man residing, through the race, ","Output":"His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect; "}
{"Input":" ","Output":"Book II                                                          "}
{"Input":"From his Creator; and, the more to encrease ","Output":"Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat "}
{"Input":"Into her heart too easy entrance won: ","Output":"Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold "}
{"Input":"To him who reigns, and so much to him due ","Output":"Of hazard more as he above the rest "}
{"Input":"  But now at last the sacred influence ","Output":"Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven "}
{"Input":"The battle hung; till Satan, who that day ","Output":"Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms "}
{"Input":"Of innocence, of faith, of purity, ","Output":"Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained, "}
{"Input":"Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind. ","Output":"Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven "}
{"Input":"  ","Output":"High on a throne of royal state, which far "}
{"Input":"Condenses, and the cold environs round, ","Output":"Kindled through agitation to a flame, "}
{"Input":"And evil turn to good; more wonderful ","Output":"Than that which by creation first brought forth "}
{"Input":"Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend, ","Output":"Self-raised, and repossess their native seat? "}
{"Input":"Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? ","Output":"And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem "}
{"Input":"Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief ","Output":"His bursting passion into plaints thus poured. "}
{"Input":"Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore ","Output":"The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine "}
{"Input":"Their universal shout, and high applause, ","Output":"To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears "}
{"Input":"So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend, ","Output":"Who came their bane; though with them better pleased "}
{"Input":"And his salvation; them who shall believe ","Output":"Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign "}
{"Input":"Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey; ","Output":"Alone, for other creature in this place, "}
{"Input":"So much the rather thou, celestial Light, ","Output":"Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers "}
{"Input":"Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light, ","Output":"And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw. "}
{"Input":"Pursues, as inclination or sad choice ","Output":"Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find "}
{"Input":"Wave rolling after wave, where way they found, ","Output":"If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, "}
{"Input":"High on a throne of royal state, which far ","Output":"Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind, "}
{"Input":"Law can discover sin, but not remove, ","Output":"Save by those shadowy expiations weak, "}
{"Input":"To me shall be the glory sole among ","Output":"The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred "}
{"Input":"I found not what methought I wanted still; ","Output":"And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed. "}
{"Input":"Their frail original, and faded bliss-- ","Output":"Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth "}
{"Input":"Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought ","Output":"Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw "}
{"Input":"Express they? by looks only? or do they mix ","Output":"Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? "}
{"Input":"Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount ","Output":"The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, "}
{"Input":"If such astonishment as this can seize ","Output":"Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place "}
{"Input":"Those happy places thou hast deigned a while ","Output":"To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell ","Output":"Of fancy, my internal sight; by which, "}
{"Input":"The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep ","Output":"Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play, "}
{"Input":"If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear; ","Output":"If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, "}
{"Input":"A nation from one faithful man to spring: ","Output":"Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, "}

{"Input":"Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands. ","Output":"Forthwith, form every squadron and each band, "}
{"Input":"First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled ","Output":"With armed watch, that render all access "}
{"Input":"As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven, ","Output":"And looking down, to see the hubbub strange, "}
{"Input":"The strict forbiddance, how to violate ","Output":"The sacred fruit forbidden!  Some cursed fraud "}
{"Input":"And in whose hand what by decree I do, ","Output":"Second Omnipotence! two days are past, "}
{"Input":"Fonntain of light, thyself invisible ","Output":"Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st "}
{"Input":"Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain ","Output":"His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part, "}
{"Input":"Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed, ","Output":"Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse, "}
{"Input":"Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, ","Output":"For haste; such flight the great command impressed "}
{"Input":"In woe then; that destruction wide may range: ","Output":"To me shall be the glory sole among "}
{"Input":"Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none ","Output":"Are to behold the judgement, but the judged, "}
{"Input":"Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now ","Output":"Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front "}
{"Input":"Or if the star of evening and the moon ","Output":"Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring, "}
{"Input":"By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign; ","Output":"As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know. "}
{"Input":"My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower ","Output":"I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven, "}
{"Input":"Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full, ","Output":"Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while "}
{"Input":"Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these ","Output":"Find place or refuge; and the more I see "}
{"Input":"Of goats or timorous flock together thronged ","Output":"Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued "}
{"Input":"Save what is in destroying; other joy ","Output":"To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass "}
{"Input":"Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear ","Output":"Of despicable foes. With these in troop "}
{"Input":"And gladly of our union hear thee speak, ","Output":"One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof "}
{"Input":"Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud ","Output":"Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow: "}

{"Input":"But from the author of all ill, could spring ","Output":"So deep a malice, to confound the race "}

{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got; ","Output":"Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know; "}
{"Input":"Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright ","Output":"Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone, "}
{"Input":"And that must end us; that must be our cure-- ","Output":"To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose, "}

{"Input":"And in their own dimensions like themselves, ","Output":"The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim "}
{"Input":"Of birds, in orderly array on wing, ","Output":"Came summoned over Eden to receive "}
{"Input":"Mankind's deliverance.  But the voice of God ","Output":"To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech "}
{"Input":"Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round, ","Output":"Behind him cast. The broad circumference "}
{"Input":" As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen. ","Output":" So on he fares, and to the border comes "}
{"Input":"By conquering this new world, compels me now ","Output":"To do what else, though damned, I should abhor. "}
{"Input":"Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed. ","Output":"Eve, easily my faith admit, that all "}

{"Input":"That all may see who hate us, how we seek ","Output":"Peace and composure, and with open breast "}
{"Input":"Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling wolf, ","Output":"Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, "}
{"Input":"More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite ","Output":"More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell, "}
{"Input":"To rule, as over all he should have ruled. ","Output":"True is, me also he hath judged, or rather "}
{"Input":"The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill ","Output":"To their fixed station, all in bright array "}
{"Input":"At thy request, and that thou mayest beware ","Output":"By what is past, to thee I have revealed "}

{"Input":"So varied he, and of his tortuous train ","Output":"Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, "}
{"Input":"Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands ","Output":"Aid us, the work under our labour grows, "}
{"Input":"In order came the grand infernal Peers: ","Output":"Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed "}
{"Input":"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow ","Output":"Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life; "}
{"Input":"Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, ","Output":"Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal. "}
{"Input":"That space the Evil-one abstracted stood ","Output":"From his own evil, and for the time remained "}
{"Input":"As from a sky. The hasty multitude ","Output":"Admiring entered; and the work some praise, "}
{"Input":"And plunge us in the flames; or from above ","Output":"Should intermitted vengeance arm again "}
{"Input":"For haste; such flight the great command impressed ","Output":"On the swift floods:  As armies at the call "}
{"Input":"With living sapphires:  Hesperus, that led ","Output":"The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon, "}
{"Input":"And guard all passage to the tree of life: ","Output":"Lest Paradise a receptacle prove "}
{"Input":"This evening from the sun's decline arrived, ","Output":"Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen "}
{"Input":"While the bright pomp ascended jubilant. ","Output":"Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung, "}
{"Input":"Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run ","Output":"Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch "}
{"Input":"Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; ","Output":"She all night long her amorous descant sung; "}
{"Input":"See far and wide:  In at this gate none pass ","Output":"The vigilance here placed, but such as come "}
{"Input":"Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, ","Output":"In every gesture dignity and love. "}
{"Input":"My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard; ","Output":"And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest "}
{"Input":"Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets, ","Output":"Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced, "}
{"Input":"And short retirement urges sweet return. ","Output":"But other doubt possesses me, lest harm "}
{"Input":"That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend, ","Output":"Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise. "}
{"Input":"The first sort by their own suggestion fell, ","Output":"Self-tempted, self-deprav'd:  Man falls, deceiv'd "}
{"Input":"Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, ","Output":"False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings, "}
{"Input":"Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being: ","Output":"Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed, "}
{"Input":"Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide ","Output":"His fiery Chaos to receive their fall. "}
{"Input":"And oft supported so as shall amaze ","Output":"Their proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit, "}
{"Input":"As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched, ","Output":"Still hanging incorruptible, till men "}
{"Input":"So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned: ","Output":"Into the heart of Eve his words made way, "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould, ","Output":"Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store, "}
{"Input":"Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped ","Output":"Famine and anguish will at last consume, "}
{"Input":"In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled, ","Output":"His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles: "}
{"Input":"And now a stripling Cherub he appears, ","Output":"Not of the prime, yet such as in his face "}
{"Input":"The Mountain of the Congregation called; ","Output":"For thither he assembled all his train, "}
{"Input":"Is enmity which he will put between ","Output":"Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel; "}
{"Input":"Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; ","Output":"Or substance might be called that shadow seemed, "}
{"Input":"Superiour, nor of violence feared aught; ","Output":"And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned "}
{"Input":"Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower. ","Output":"Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. "}
{"Input":"And various:  Wondering at my flight and change ","Output":"To this high exaltation; suddenly "}
{"Input":"Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, ","Output":"Son, in whose face invisible is beheld "}
{"Input":"To teach all nations what of him they learned ","Output":"And his salvation; them who shall believe "}
{"Input":"How first began this Heaven which we behold ","Output":"Distant so high, with moving fires adorned "}
{"Input":"Each quarter to descry the distant foe, ","Output":"Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight, "}
{"Input":"Greedily she ingorged without restraint, ","Output":"And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length, "}
{"Input":"And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne, ","Output":"To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence "}

{"Input":"All thy dominion, Adam, is no more ","Output":"Than what this garden is to all the earth, "}
{"Input":"So wise he judges it to fly from pain ","Output":"However, and to 'scape his punishment! "}
{"Input":"Such follow him, as shall be registered ","Output":"Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll; "}
{"Input":"As doth your rational; and both contain ","Output":"Within them every lower faculty "}
{"Input":"Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban, ","Output":"Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, "}
{"Input":"That war and various; sometimes on firm ground ","Output":"A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing, "}
{"Input":"Her long with ardent look his eye pursued ","Output":"Delighted, but desiring more her stay. "}
{"Input":"Her tresses, and her rural labours crown; ","Output":"As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen. "}
{"Input":"Of arts that polish life, inventers rare; ","Output":"Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit "}
{"Input":"Those thoughts that wander through eternity, ","Output":"To perish rather, swallowed up and lost "}
{"Input":"Had ended; when to right and left the front ","Output":"Divided, and to either flank retired: "}

{"Input":"To that new world of light and bliss, among ","Output":"The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign "}
{"Input":"Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how ","Output":"He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve, "}

{"Input":"Moses in figure bears; to introduce ","Output":"One greater, of whose day he shall foretel, "}
{"Input":"As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole. ","Output":"Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell! "}
{"Input":"Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire, ","Output":"Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout "}
{"Input":"Holy and pure, conformity divine. ","Output":"Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents "}
{"Input":"Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard ","Output":"In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears "}
{"Input":"As one disarmed, his anger all he lost, ","Output":"And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon. "}
{"Input":"Vacant possession, some new trouble raise: ","Output":"Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God "}
{"Input":"About her, as a guard angelick placed. ","Output":"To whom the Angel with contracted brow. "}
{"Input":"This answer from the gracious Voice Divine. ","Output":"Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased; "}

{"Input":"Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace ","Output":"And rest can never dwell, hope never comes "}
{"Input":"From all her caves, and back resounded Death! ","Output":"I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems, "}
{"Input":"His red right hand to plague us? What if all ","Output":"Her stores were opened, and this firmament "}
{"Input":"And Spirit, coming to create new worlds. ","Output":"On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore "}

{"Input":"Both where the morning sun first warmly smote ","Output":"The open field, and where the unpierced shade "}
{"Input":"On his great expedition now appeared, ","Output":"Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned "}
{"Input":"My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared, ","Output":"But still rejoiced; how is it now become "}
{"Input":"On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds ","Output":"That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip "}
{"Input":"Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love; ","Output":"Not thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself; "}
{"Input":"In fable or romance of Uther's son, ","Output":"Begirt with British and Armoric knights; "}
{"Input":"Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, ","Output":"And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life. "}
{"Input":"As in our evils, and of easier choice. ","Output":"If care of our descent perplex us most, "}
{"Input":"And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed ","Output":"Alone, without exteriour help sustained? "}
{"Input":"Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight, ","Output":"Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst, "}
{"Input":"As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host ","Output":"Of Angels by imperial summons called, "}
{"Input":"And all amid them stood the tree of life, ","Output":"High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit "}
{"Input":"I, therefore, I alone first undertook ","Output":"To wing the desolate abyss, and spy "}
{"Input":"The speediest of thy winged messengers, ","Output":"To visit all thy creatures, and to all "}
{"Input":"Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view ","Output":"Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad; "}
{"Input":"In strictest bondage, though thus far removed, ","Output":"Under th' inevitable curb, reserved "}
{"Input":"His laughter at their quaint opinions wide ","Output":"Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven "}
{"Input":"To claim our just inheritance of old, ","Output":"Surer to prosper than prosperity "}
{"Input":"Ascended; at his right hand Victory ","Output":"Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow "}
{"Input":"A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog ","Output":"Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, "}
{"Input":"Human imagination to such highth ","Output":"Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed, "}

{"Input":"Destruction to the rest:  This pause between, ","Output":"(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know, "}
{"Input":"Express, and of his steps the track divine. ","Output":"Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed "}
{"Input":"From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed, ","Output":"Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth, "}

{"Input":"Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts ","Output":"Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark "}
{"Input":"Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith ","Output":"He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed "}
{"Input":"Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat ","Output":"Allotted there; and other suns perhaps, "}
{"Input":"Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak ","Output":"Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise "}
{"Input":"The rest, in imitation, to like arms ","Output":"Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore: "}
{"Input":"The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour, ","Output":"Two birds of gayest plume before him drove; "}
{"Input":"Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest; ","Output":"Death is the penalty imposed; beware, "}

{"Input":"Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause ","Output":"Through the infinite host; nor less for that "}
{"Input":"And excellent, than what thy mind contemns; ","Output":"But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes "}
{"Input":"There didst not; there let him still victor sway, ","Output":"As battle hath adjudged; from this new world "}
{"Input":"Before my Judge; either to undergo ","Output":"Myself the total crime, or to accuse "}
{"Input":"Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world ","Output":"Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain "}
{"Input":"To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds ","Output":"Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung, "}
{"Input":"Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines, ","Output":"With singed top their stately growth, though bare, "}
{"Input":"The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve ","Output":"Had ended now their orisons, and found "}
{"Input":"Not that more glorious, when the Angels met ","Output":"Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw "}
{"Input":"Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!\" ","Output":"  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old, "}
{"Input":"That reaches blame, but rather merits praise ","Output":"The more it seems excess, that led thee hither "}
{"Input":"Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute ","Output":"Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far "}
{"Input":"For such vast room in Nature unpossessed ","Output":"By living soul, desart and desolate, "}
{"Input":"But long ere our approaching heard within ","Output":"Noise, other than the sound of dance or song, "}
{"Input":"So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts ","Output":"Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm. "}
{"Input":"Before his voice? or was she made thy guide, ","Output":"Superiour, or but equal, that to her "}
{"Input":"Against allurement, custom, and a world ","Output":"Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn, "}
{"Input":"Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek ","Output":"Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms "}
{"Input":"His kindred, and false Gods, into a land ","Output":"Which he will show him; and from him will raise "}
{"Input":"Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small, ","Output":"Nor glistering, may of solid good contain "}
{"Input":"Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn. ","Output":"Now, when as sacred light began to dawn "}
{"Input":"The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat ","Output":"Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die. "}
{"Input":"Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, ","Output":"Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, "}
{"Input":"To mortal combat, or career with lance), ","Output":"Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air, "}
{"Input":"Enmity, and between thine and her seed; ","Output":"Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. "}
{"Input":"Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love; ","Output":"To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss. "}
{"Input":"Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, ","Output":"Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed "}
{"Input":"Where pain of unextinguishable fire ","Output":"Must exercise us without hope of end "}
{"Input":"For envy; yet with jealous leer malign ","Output":"Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained. "}
{"Input":"To our destruction, if there be in Hell ","Output":"Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse "}
{"Input":"Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain, ","Output":"For envy that his brother's offering found "}
{"Input":"To whom thus also the Angel last replied. ","Output":"This having learned, thou hast attained the sum "}
{"Input":"This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill. ","Output":"To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear, "}
{"Input":"Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, ","Output":"Their tendance, or plantation for delight; "}
{"Input":"And great exploits, but of true virtue void; ","Output":"Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast "}
{"Input":"To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers, ","Output":"Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet. "}
{"Input":"To find who might direct his wandering flight ","Output":"To Paradise, the happy seat of Man, "}
{"Input":"To set himself in glory above his peers, ","Output":"He trusted to have equalled the Most High, "}
{"Input":"By living soul, desart and desolate, ","Output":"Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute "}
{"Input":"These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, ","Output":"Almighty!  Thine this universal frame, "}
{"Input":"Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell ","Output":"From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove "}
{"Input":"Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now ","Output":"The fall of others from like state of bliss; "}
{"Input":"Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side ","Output":"They sat them down; and, after no more toil "}
{"Input":"Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought ","Output":"My story to the sum of earthly bliss, "}
{"Input":"  Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command ","Output":"Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony "}
{"Input":"Than all this globous earth in plain outspread, ","Output":"(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng, "}
{"Input":"Tempest the ocean: there leviathan, ","Output":"Hugest of living creatures, on the deep "}
{"Input":"Worse then can man with beast, and least of all. ","Output":"Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased. "}
{"Input":"Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit ","Output":"That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. "}
{"Input":"All usurpation thence expelled, reduce ","Output":"To her original darkness and your sway "}
{"Input":"Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared ","Output":"In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire, "}
{"Input":"So easily obeyed amid the choice ","Output":"Of all tastes else to please their appetite, "}
{"Input":"By model, or by shading pencil, drawn. ","Output":"These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw "}
{"Input":"Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume, ","Output":"And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat "}
{"Input":"Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven, ","Output":"The great hierarchal standard was to move; "}
{"Input":"His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw ","Output":"Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced "}
{"Input":"Up-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze, ","Output":"Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host, "}
{"Input":"Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung, ","Output":"And gladly of our union hear thee speak, "}
{"Input":"Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks ","Output":"Round from his parted forelock manly hung "}
{"Input":"Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness, ","Output":"That cuts us off from hope; and savours only "}
{"Input":"Of amplitude almost immense, with stars ","Output":"Numerous, and every star perhaps a world "}
{"Input":"Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss, ","Output":"Into their place of punishment, the gulf "}
{"Input":"Though heaviest by just measure on thyself, ","Output":"And thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed "}
{"Input":"Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes ","Output":"And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee "}
{"Input":"Was death invented? or to us denied ","Output":"This intellectual food, for beasts reserved? "}
{"Input":"To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope ","Output":"Things not revealed, which the invisible King, "}
{"Input":"No more was seen: the floating vessel swum ","Output":"Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow "}
{"Input":"Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime, ","Output":"Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove. "}
{"Input":"Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell ","Output":"Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse "}
{"Input":"Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek ","Output":"No happier state, and know to know no more. "}
{"Input":"Of his eternal empire, but the more ","Output":"To magnify his works, the more we know. "}
{"Input":"As at the world's great period; and our sire, ","Output":"Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied. "}
{"Input":"None of retreat, no unbecoming deed ","Output":"That argued fear; each on himself relied, "}
{"Input":"Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair ","Output":"In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight "}
{"Input":"In counterpoise, now ponders all events, ","Output":"Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights, "}
{"Input":"Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance. ","Output":"Their song was partial; but the harmony "}
{"Input":"Or sympathy, or some connatural force, ","Output":"Powerful at greatest distance to unite, "}
{"Input":"To perish rather, swallowed up and lost ","Output":"In the wide womb of uncreated Night, "}
{"Input":"Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand ","Output":"First wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire "}
{"Input":"To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. ","Output":"Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged "}
{"Input":"Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being ","Output":"Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. "}
{"Input":"And injury and outrage; and, when night ","Output":"Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons "}
{"Input":"Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired. ","Output":"Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain, "}
{"Input":"Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed; ","Output":"Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while "}
{"Input":"And calculate the stars, how they will wield ","Output":"The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive "}
{"Input":"With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, ","Output":"With glory attributed to the high "}
{"Input":"Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines ","Output":"Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long "}
{"Input":"Shall tremble, he descending, will himself ","Output":"In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound, "}
{"Input":"Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King, ","Output":"And put to proof his high supremacy, "}
{"Input":"Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact ","Output":"Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit, "}
{"Input":"The doubt, since human reach no further knows. ","Output":"For though the Lord of all be infinite, "}
{"Input":"And all temptation to transgress repel. ","Output":"So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus "}
{"Input":"And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed ","Output":"This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat "}
{"Input":"Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream; ","Output":"With these that never fade the Spirits elect "}
{"Input":"With devilish machination, might devise ","Output":"Like instrument to plague the sons of men "}
{"Input":"With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing ","Output":"Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits "}
{"Input":"Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed: ","Output":"Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length "}
{"Input":"On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned, ","Output":"They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet "}
{"Input":"To proper substance.  Time may come, when Men ","Output":"With Angels may participate, and find "}
{"Input":"And now, divided into four main streams, ","Output":"Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm "}
{"Input":"Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled; ","Output":"Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid. "}
{"Input":"Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached ","Output":"Conversion and repentance, as to souls "}
{"Input":"Each warriour single as in chief, expert ","Output":"When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway "}
{"Input":"What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks? ","Output":"Here let us live, though in fallen state, content. "}
{"Input":"Her unadorned golden tresses wore ","Output":"Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved "}
{"Input":"The angelick name, and thinner left the throng ","Output":"Of his adorers: He, to be avenged, "}
{"Input":"If any be, of tasting this fair fruit; ","Output":"Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds, "}
{"Input":"O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers! ","Output":"With other echo late I taught your shades "}
{"Input":"Awaits the good; the rest what punishment; ","Output":"Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. "}
{"Input":"His braided train, and of his fatal guile ","Output":"Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass "}
{"Input":"Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees ","Output":"Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen "}
{"Input":"But listen not to his temptations, warn ","Output":"Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, "}
{"Input":"Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears ","Output":"Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air "}
{"Input":"And thus his own undaunted heart explores. ","Output":"O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest "}
{"Input":"Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven. ","Output":"Nor failed they to express how much they praised "}
{"Input":"Directly towards the new created world, ","Output":"And man there plac'd, with purpose to assay "}
{"Input":"Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared ","Output":"Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged "}
{"Input":"The clouded ark of God, till then in tents ","Output":"Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine. "}
{"Input":"Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content ","Output":"With fair equality, fraternal state, "}
{"Input":"Going into such danger, as thou saidst? ","Output":"Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay; "}
{"Input":"More tuneable than needed lute or harp ","Output":"To add more sweetness; and they thus began. "}
{"Input":"From thee alone, which on us both at once ","Output":"The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare; "}
{"Input":"Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war, ","Output":"Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise; "}
{"Input":"Methought I saw him placable and mild, ","Output":"Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew "}
{"Input":"A woody mountain; whose high top was plain, ","Output":"A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees "}
{"Input":"Had melted, (whether found where casual fire ","Output":"Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, "}
{"Input":"On to their morning's rural work they haste, ","Output":"Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row "}
{"Input":"This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat ","Output":"Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt "}
{"Input":"Adam, estranged in look and altered style, ","Output":"Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed. "}
{"Input":"Some days: how long, and what till then our life, ","Output":"Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust, "}
{"Input":"No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare; ","Output":"And from these corporal nutriments perhaps "}
{"Input":"Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid ","Output":"The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, "}
{"Input":"O visions ill foreseen!  Better had I ","Output":"Lived ignorant of future! so had borne "}
{"Input":"Desirous; all in circles as they stood, ","Output":"Tables are set, and on a sudden piled "}
{"Input":"Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green, ","Output":"Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, "}
{"Input":"Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell ","Output":"Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings, "}
{"Input":"Sole, or responsive each to others note, ","Output":"Singing their great Creator? oft in bands "}
{"Input":"In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they ","Output":"First seen in acts of prowess eminent "}
{"Input":"But in the fruitful Earth; there first received, ","Output":"His beams, unactive else, their vigour find. "}
{"Input":"Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold; ","Output":"That all may see who hate us, how we seek "}
{"Input":"Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those ","Output":"Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! "}
{"Input":"The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh ","Output":"Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed "}
{"Input":"Thee I have heard relating what was done ","Output":"Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate "}
{"Input":"To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz ","Output":"Dreaming by night under the open sky "}
{"Input":"The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found ","Output":"In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled, "}
{"Input":"And set them in the firmament of Heaven ","Output":"To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day "}
{"Input":"Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought: ","Output":"Or come I less conspicuous, or what change "}
{"Input":"Pattern of just equality perhaps ","Output":"Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude. ","Output":"He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared "}
{"Input":"Such as we might perceive amused them all, ","Output":"And stumbled many:  Who receives them right, "}
{"Input":"Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned; ","Output":"The way which to her ruin now I tend. "}
{"Input":"That time celestial visages, yet, mixed ","Output":"With pity, violated not their bliss. "}
{"Input":"All space, the ambient air wide interfused ","Output":"Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause "}
{"Input":"The originals of nature in their crude ","Output":"Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam "}
{"Input":"To overcome in battle, and subdue ","Output":"Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite "}
{"Input":"Though not of woman born; compassion quelled ","Output":"His best of man, and gave him up to tears "}
{"Input":"Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand ","Output":"He took the golden compasses, prepared "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Michael.  Dream not of their fight, ","Output":"As of a duel, or the local wounds "}
{"Input":"Lived ignorant of future! so had borne ","Output":"My part of evil only, each day's lot "}
{"Input":"Subtle or violent, we not endued ","Output":"Single with like defence, wherever met; "}
{"Input":"Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth; ","Output":"And what most merits fame, in silence hid. "}
{"Input":"Presenting, thus to intercede began. ","Output":"See$ Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung "}
{"Input":"Set over all his works; which in our fall, ","Output":"For us created, needs with us must fail, "}
{"Input":"To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, ","Output":"Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, "}
{"Input":"Through the pure marble air his oblique way ","Output":"Amongst innumerable stars, that shone "}
{"Input":"Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived ","Output":"Thy presence; agony of love till now "}
{"Input":"Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, ","Output":"Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky "}
{"Input":"Redouble then this miracle, and say, ","Output":"How camest thou speakable of mute, and how "}
{"Input":"Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve ","Output":"In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine "}
{"Input":"Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear ","Output":"The better reason, to perplex and dash "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high; ","Output":"At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared "}
{"Input":"Who out of smallest things could, without end, ","Output":"Have raised incessant armies to defeat "}
{"Input":"Of Angels under watch; and to his state, ","Output":"And to his message high, in honour rise; "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Adam gratefully replied. ","Output":"Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path "}
{"Input":"Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse, ","Output":"More tuneable than needed lute or harp "}
{"Input":"Which would be all his solace and revenge, ","Output":"As a despite done against the Most High, "}
{"Input":"His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut. ","Output":"The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground, "}
{"Input":"Nor failed they to express how much they praised ","Output":"That for the general safety he despised "}
{"Input":"Could alter high decrees, I to that place ","Output":"Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, "}
{"Input":"His cattle must of rot and murren die; ","Output":"Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss, "}
{"Input":"Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord ","Output":"Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know? "}
{"Input":"Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, ","Output":"His own invented torments. But perhaps "}
{"Input":"Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart ","Output":"Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build "}
{"Input":"So having said, as one from sad dismay ","Output":"Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed "}
{"Input":"By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake ","Output":"Is fortitude to highest victory, "}
{"Input":"Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds ","Output":"With him I flew, and underneath beheld "}
{"Input":"Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells ","Output":"With honey stored:  The rest are numberless, "}
{"Input":"Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now ","Output":"My hold of this new kingdom all depends, "}
{"Input":"Created mute to all articulate sound: ","Output":"The latter I demur; for in their looks "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change, ","Output":"Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise, "}
{"Input":"With their bright luminaries that set and rose, ","Output":"Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. "}
{"Input":"Stretched into longitude; which having passed, ","Output":"At length into the limits of the north "}
{"Input":"Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen, ","Output":"That stone, or like to that which here below "}
{"Input":"Those pure immortal elements, that know, ","Output":"No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul, "}
{"Input":"In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play, ","Output":"Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft "}
{"Input":"Perpetual banishment.  Yet, lest they faint ","Output":"At the sad sentence rigorously urged, "}
{"Input":"Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves ","Output":"Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance, "}
{"Input":"Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands ","Output":"No second stroke intend; and such a frown "}
{"Input":"To your behoof, if I that region lost, ","Output":"All usurpation thence expelled, reduce "}
{"Input":"And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. ","Output":"So spake our general mother, and with eyes "}
{"Input":"Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret ","Output":"For loss of life and pleasure overloved. "}
{"Input":"And flattered out of all, believing lies ","Output":"Against his Maker; no decree of mine "}
{"Input":"With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; ","Output":"That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light "}
{"Input":"With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused ","Output":"Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek "}
{"Input":"Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! ","Output":"How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost, "}
{"Input":"Philosophers in vain so long have sought, ","Output":"In vain, though by their powerful art they bind "}
{"Input":"Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins, ","Output":"That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me. "}
{"Input":"To do what else, though damned, I should abhor. ","Output":"So spake the Fiend, and with necessity, "}
{"Input":"Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring ","Output":"Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove, "}
{"Input":"Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, ","Output":"Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, "}
{"Input":"And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer ","Output":"Before all temples th' upright heart and pure, "}
{"Input":"To mould me Man? did I solicit thee ","Output":"From darkness to promote me, or here place "}
{"Input":"Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, ","Output":"Satan exalted sat, by merit raised "}
{"Input":"So said he, and forbore not glance or toy ","Output":"Of amorous intent; well understood "}
{"Input":"God is, as here; and will be found alike ","Output":"Present; and of his presence many a sign "}
{"Input":"Over the burning marl, not like those steps ","Output":"On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime "}
{"Input":"But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more, ","Output":"That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; "}
{"Input":"He with Olympias; this with her who bore ","Output":"Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique "}
{"Input":"The parsimonious emmet, provident ","Output":"Of future; in small room large heart enclosed; "}
{"Input":"With what may be devised of honours new, ","Output":"Receive him coming to receive from us "}
{"Input":"Of that Plutonian hall, invisible ","Output":"Ascended his high throne; which, under state "}
{"Input":"To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day ","Output":"In their vicissitude, and rule the night, "}
{"Input":"Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up ","Output":"Both his beloved Man, and all his world, "}
{"Input":"With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold; ","Output":"Whose eye so superficially surveys "}
{"Input":"But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, ","Output":"How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks, "}
{"Input":"Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored, ","Output":"If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; "}
{"Input":"Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed ","Output":"Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight "}
{"Input":"And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, ","Output":"Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise "}
{"Input":"In silence their bright legions, to the sound ","Output":"Of instrumental harmony, that breathed "}
{"Input":"Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound ","Output":"The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven "}
{"Input":"How can I live without thee! how forego ","Output":"Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined, "}
{"Input":"For never can true reconcilement grow, ","Output":"Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep: "}
{"Input":"Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine. ","Output":"So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. "}
{"Input":"Now death to hear! for what can I encrease, ","Output":"Or multiply, but curses on my head? "}
{"Input":"The other none:  In mercy and justice both, ","Output":"Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel; "}
{"Input":"Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep; ","Output":"So wonderously was set his station bright. "}
{"Input":"Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed. ","Output":"Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, "}
{"Input":"To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned ","Output":"Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend "}
{"Input":"Such high advantages their innocence ","Output":"Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned, "}
{"Input":"Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame, ","Output":"To find himself not matchless, and his pride "}
{"Input":"Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve, ","Output":"While the great visitant approached, thus spake. "}

{"Input":"Up hither, under long obedience tried; ","Output":"And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth, "}
{"Input":"Palpable darkness, and blot out three days; ","Output":"Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born "}
{"Input":"None seconded, as out of season judged, ","Output":"Or singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced "}
{"Input":"Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue ","Output":"Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart "}
{"Input":"Whose eye so superficially surveys ","Output":"These things, as not to mind from whence they grow "}
{"Input":"A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream, ","Output":"And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed "}
{"Input":"Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow ","Output":"But firm battalion; back with speediest sail "}

{"Input":"Is this the love, is this the recompence ","Output":"Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed "}

{"Input":"He trusted to have equalled the Most High, ","Output":"If he opposed, and with ambitious aim "}
{"Input":"I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep ","Output":"Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth; "}
{"Input":"Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. ","Output":"Not free, what proof could they have given sincere "}
{"Input":"Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent, ","Output":"From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled "}
{"Input":"For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses ","Output":"The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed "}

{"Input":"The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace ","Output":"Invites; for I will clear their senses dark, "}
{"Input":"The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, ","Output":"As was my food; nor aught but food discerned "}
{"Input":"Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice, ","Output":"From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard. "}
{"Input":"With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift, ","Output":"Down the great river to the opening gulf, "}
{"Input":"Danced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold; ","Output":"No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began "}
{"Input":"And temple of his Mighty Father throned ","Output":"On high; who into glory him received, "}
{"Input":"And devils to adore for deities: ","Output":"Then were they known to men by various names, "}
{"Input":"With reason hath deep silence and demur ","Output":"Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way "}
{"Input":"Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, ","Output":"And thus his own undaunted heart explores. "}
{"Input":"Male he created thee; but thy consort ","Output":"Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said, "}
{"Input":"To me, and to my offspring, would torment me ","Output":"With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt "}
{"Input":"In eminence; and obstacle find none ","Output":"Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars; "}
{"Input":"Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key, ","Output":"Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between. "}
{"Input":"A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, ","Output":"And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained "}
{"Input":"To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late ","Output":"Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell "}
{"Input":"Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb, ","Output":"Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth "}
{"Input":"Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark ","Output":"Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid "}
{"Input":"Back to his chariot, where it stood retired ","Output":"From off the files of war:  There they him laid "}
{"Input":"Of onset ended soon each milder thought. ","Output":"High in the midst, exalted as a God, "}
{"Input":"Than what this garden is to all the earth, ","Output":"And all the sea, from one entire globose "}
{"Input":"So spake domestick Adam in his care ","Output":"And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought "}
{"Input":"Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; ","Output":"Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth; "}
{"Input":"Exalted from so base original, ","Output":"With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed, "}
{"Input":"With fresh alacrity and force renewed ","Output":"Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire, "}
{"Input":"Varied his bounty so with new delights, ","Output":"As may compare with Heaven; and to taste "}
{"Input":"By the celestial quires, when orient light ","Output":"Exhaling first from darkness they beheld; "}
{"Input":"Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix ","Output":"Their seats, long after, next the seat of God, "}
{"Input":"Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace ","Output":"With suppliant knee, and deify his power "}
{"Input":"Creation, and the wonders of his might. ","Output":"Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand "}
{"Input":"Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, ","Output":"According to his doom: he would have spoke, "}
{"Input":"And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall ","Output":"Free in thine own arbitrement it lies. "}
{"Input":"Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most ","Output":"Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. "}
{"Input":"Can he make deathless death?  That were to make ","Output":"Strange contradiction, which to God himself "}
{"Input":"Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind, ","Output":"They sat them down to weep; nor only tears "}
{"Input":"With every plant, in sign of worship wave. ","Output":"Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow, "}
{"Input":"Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable ","Output":"To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad "}
{"Input":"As soft as now severe, our temper changed ","Output":"Into their temper; which must needs remove "}
{"Input":"And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss ","Output":"Ordained by thee; and this delicious place "}
{"Input":"'Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear ","Output":"'Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called "}
{"Input":"Established, such delight hath God in Men ","Output":"Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes "}
{"Input":"Already known what he for news had thought ","Output":"To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed "}
{"Input":"By me; not you, but me, they have despised, ","Output":"Yet envied; against me is all their rage, "}
{"Input":"Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. ","Output":"Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, "}
{"Input":"Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold, ","Output":"Destruction with creation might have mixed. "}
{"Input":"By force hath overcome but half his foe. ","Output":"Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife "}
{"Input":"This I perform; speak thou, and be it done! ","Output":"My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee "}
{"Input":"That I, who first brought death on all, am graced ","Output":"The source of life; next favourable thou, "}
{"Input":"Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when ","Output":"Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought "}
{"Input":"With what permissive glory since his fall ","Output":"Was left him, or false glitter:  All amazed "}
{"Input":"Of God or death, of law or penalty? ","Output":"Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, "}
{"Input":"Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill ","Output":"Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. "}
{"Input":"Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell. ","Output":"So, if great things to small may be compared, "}
{"Input":"Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool, ","Output":"And call them not to share with us their part "}
{"Input":"With all his peers: attention held them mute. ","Output":"Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn, "}
{"Input":"Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring ","Output":"To set himself in glory above his peers, "}
{"Input":"For heavenly minds from such distempers foul ","Output":"Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware, "}
{"Input":"Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid, ","Output":"Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, "}
{"Input":"The willinger I go, nor much expect ","Output":"A foe so proud will first the weaker seek; "}
{"Input":"Shone full; he all his Father full expressed ","Output":"Ineffably into his face received; "}
{"Input":"Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) ","Output":"Have left us this our spirit and strength entire, "}
{"Input":"The breath of life; in his own image he ","Output":"Created thee, in the image of God "}
{"Input":"Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn ","Output":"To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, "}
{"Input":"Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt; ","Output":"And forth to meet her went, the way she took "}
{"Input":"Where he abides, think there thy native soil. ","Output":"Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp "}
{"Input":"On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol ","Output":"Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. "}
{"Input":"That thou continuest such, owe to thyself, ","Output":"That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. "}
{"Input":"And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven ","Output":"Flew upward, spirited with various forms, "}
{"Input":"Or of the Thrones above; such majesty ","Output":"Invests him coming! yet not terrible, "}
{"Input":"Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause! ","Output":"But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way "}
{"Input":"Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile ","Output":"Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared, "}
{"Input":"Strange contradiction, which to God himself ","Output":"Impossible is held; as argument "}
{"Input":"To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass ","Output":"Occasion which now smiles; behold alone "}
{"Input":"Branching so broad and long, that in the ground ","Output":"The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow "}
{"Input":"Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn ","Output":"From his displeasure; in whose look serene, "}
{"Input":"Of this great round; partition firm and sure, ","Output":"The waters underneath from those above "}
{"Input":"Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might. ","Output":"But what owe I to his commands above, "}
{"Input":"The realm itself of Satan, long usurped; ","Output":"Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; "}
{"Input":"But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine. ","Output":"Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd "}
{"Input":"In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, ","Output":"All in one moment, and so near the brink; "}
{"Input":"Dispenses light from far; they, as they move ","Output":"Their starry dance in numbers that compute "}
{"Input":"Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. ","Output":"At once, as far as Angels ken, he views "}
{"Input":"Timely interposes, and her monthly round ","Output":"Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven, "}
{"Input":"A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine, ","Output":"From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock, "}
{"Input":"The savour of death from all things there that live: ","Output":"Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest "}
{"Input":"Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy ","Output":"Was understood, the injured lover's hell. "}
{"Input":"A pomp of winning Graces waited still, ","Output":"And from about her shot darts of desire "}
{"Input":"From prone; nor in their ways complacence find. ","Output":"Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used "}
{"Input":"He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl, ","Output":"Dominion absolute; that right we hold "}
{"Input":"The second time returning, in his bill ","Output":"An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign: "}
{"Input":"As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased, ","Output":"Advising peace: for such another field "}
{"Input":"Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear, ","Output":"And with persuasive accent thus began:-- "}
{"Input":"Rising or falling still advance his praise. ","Output":"His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow, "}
{"Input":"Under a tuft of shade that on a green ","Output":"Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side "}
{"Input":"What within Eden, or without, was done ","Output":"Before his memory; as one whose drouth "}
{"Input":"And equal to reduce me to my dust; ","Output":"Desirous to resign and render back "}
{"Input":"Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve ","Output":"To glorify the Maker, and infer "}
{"Input":"The Assessour of his throne, he thus began. ","Output":"Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, "}
{"Input":"Think only what concerns thee, and thy being; ","Output":"Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there "}
{"Input":"Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass ","Output":"Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat, "}
{"Input":"Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred ","Output":"All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell. "}
{"Input":"From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts ","Output":"Were always downward bent, admiring more "}
{"Input":"He walked with, to support uneasy steps ","Output":"Over the burning marl, not like those steps "}
{"Input":"And dying rise, and rising with him raise ","Output":"His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life. "}
{"Input":"Say, for such wonder claims attention due. ","Output":"To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied. "}
{"Input":"Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling ","Output":"The evil on him brought by me, will curse "}
{"Input":"According to his doom: he would have spoke, ","Output":"But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue "}
{"Input":"Worse with his followers than with him they dealt? ","Output":"Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven "}
{"Input":"Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length ","Output":"Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled "}
{"Input":"And strength, and art, are easily outdone ","Output":"By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour "}
{"Input":"With like desire; which would be misery ","Output":"And torment less than none of what we dread; "}
{"Input":"Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd ","Output":"In meditated fraud and malice, bent "}
{"Input":"Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound ","Output":"Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared "}
{"Input":"To transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires ","Output":"Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire "}
{"Input":"To final battle drew, disdaining flight, ","Output":"Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God "}
{"Input":"Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing ","Output":"Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan "}
{"Input":"Innumerable as the stars of night, ","Output":"Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun "}
{"Input":"For Man's offence.  O unexampled love, ","Output":"Love no where to be found less than Divine! "}
{"Input":"Best image of myself, and dearer half, ","Output":"The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep "}
{"Input":"And henceforth monarchy with thee divide ","Output":"Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds, "}
{"Input":"By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed? ","Output":"The first, at least, of these I thought denied "}
{"Input":"So spake the Son, and into terrour changed ","Output":"His countenance too severe to be beheld, "}
{"Input":"Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss ","Output":"Enjoyed by us excites his envy more; "}
{"Input":"Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged ","Output":"Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand, "}
{"Input":"Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought, ","Output":"Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned: "}
{"Input":"And flowers aloft shading the fount of life, ","Output":"And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven "}
{"Input":"Though single.  From amidst them forth he passed, ","Output":"Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained "}
{"Input":"Silence accompanied; for beast and bird, ","Output":"They to their grassy couch, these to their nests "}
{"Input":"As if predestination over-rul'd ","Output":"Their will dispos'd by absolute decree "}
{"Input":"His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!\" ","Output":"  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest "}
{"Input":"Through all his realm, and there confounded leave; ","Output":"Then enter into glory, and resume "}
{"Input":"Or aught that might his happy state secure, ","Output":"Secure from outward force; within himself "}
{"Input":"To me committed, and by me exposed. ","Output":"But rise;--let us no more contend, nor blame "}
{"Input":"The secrets of another world, perhaps ","Output":"Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good "}
{"Input":"Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned ","Output":"With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee "}
{"Input":"Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. ","Output":"O shame to men! Devil with devil damned "}
{"Input":"And guides the eastern sages, who inquire ","Output":"His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold: "}
{"Input":"Transported touch; here passion first I felt, ","Output":"Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else "}
{"Input":"Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, ","Output":"A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, "}
{"Input":"Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, ","Output":"Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. "}
{"Input":"Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold ","Output":"Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide "}
{"Input":"Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires ","Output":"Vernal delight and joy, able to drive "}
{"Input":"Which now sat high in his meridian tower: ","Output":"Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began. "}
{"Input":"And heavier fall:  so should I purchase dear ","Output":"Short intermission bought with double smart. "}
{"Input":"Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed ","Output":"In the sun's orb, made porous to receive "}
{"Input":"From thy empyreal mansion thus alone, ","Output":"To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps, "}
{"Input":"And high disdain from sense of injured merit, ","Output":"That with the Mightiest raised me to contend, "}
{"Input":"Not likely to part hence without contest; ","Output":"Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. "}
{"Input":"More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell, ","Output":"Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs "}
{"Input":"Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard, ","Output":"Mount Amara, though this by some supposed "}
{"Input":"Their course through thickest constellations held, ","Output":"Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, "}
{"Input":"Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel. ","Output":"To whom thus Michael.  Dream not of their fight, "}
{"Input":"Nearly it now concerns us to be sure ","Output":"Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms "}
{"Input":"The suburb of their straw-built citadel, ","Output":"New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer "}
{"Input":"And with rebounding surge the bars assailed, ","Output":"That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate, "}
{"Input":"That both in him and all things, as is meet, ","Output":"The universal Maker we may praise; "}
{"Input":"And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. ","Output":"Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed "}
{"Input":"So, if great things to small may be compared, ","Output":"Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, "}
{"Input":"Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky ","Output":"Like a dark cieling stood; down rushed the rain "}
{"Input":"Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell ","Output":"By doom severe, had not the Son of God, "}
{"Input":"With speed what force is left, and all employ ","Output":"In our defence; lest unawares we lose "}
{"Input":"Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. ","Output":"He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed; "}
{"Input":"On me already lost, me than thyself ","Output":"More miserable!  Both have sinned;but thou "}
{"Input":"Handed they went; and, eased the putting off ","Output":"These troublesome disguises which we wear, "}
{"Input":"I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold ","Output":"The danger, and the lurking enemy "}
{"Input":"And rest can never dwell, hope never comes ","Output":"That comes to all, but torture without end "}
{"Input":"Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,) ","Output":"Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew; "}
{"Input":"Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall ","Output":"One day upon our heads; while we perhaps, "}
{"Input":"Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth ","Output":"Triumphant out of this infernal pit "}
{"Input":"And on, methought, alone I passed through ways ","Output":"That brought me on a sudden to the tree "}
{"Input":"It seemed, now seems a boundless continent ","Output":"Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night "}
{"Input":"That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man, ","Output":"Internal Man, is but proportion meet; "}
{"Input":"Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers, ","Output":"And injury and outrage; and, when night "}
{"Input":"But what created mind can comprehend ","Output":"Their number, or the wisdom infinite "}
{"Input":"Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast ","Output":"Subduing nations, and achieved thereby "}
{"Input":"Above them all th' Archangel: but his face ","Output":"Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care "}
{"Input":"Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, ","Output":"Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced. "}
{"Input":"Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain ","Output":"Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! "}
{"Input":"Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power; ","Output":"My Maker, be propitious while I speak. "}
{"Input":"Michael and his Angels prevalent ","Output":"Encamping, placed in guard their watches round, "}
{"Input":"To civil justice; part, religious rites ","Output":"Of sacrifice; informing them, by types "}
{"Input":"Inflicted? and what peace can we return, ","Output":"But, to our power, hostility and hate, "}
{"Input":"Incensed with indignation, Satan stood ","Output":"Unterrified, and like a comet burned, "}
{"Input":"But apt the mind or fancy is to rove ","Output":"Unchecked, and of her roving is no end; "}
{"Input":"Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild, ","Output":"Up from the bottom turned by furious winds "}
{"Input":"That spot, to which I point, is Paradise, ","Output":"Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower. "}
{"Input":"With envy against the Son of God, that day ","Output":"Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed "}
{"Input":"Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, ","Output":"Palpable darkness, and blot out three days; "}
{"Input":"To know their God, or message to regard, ","Output":"Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire; "}
{"Input":"But say I could repent, and could obtain, ","Output":"By act of grace, my former state; how soon "}
{"Input":"And to the fierce contentions brought along ","Output":"Innumerable force of Spirits armed, "}
{"Input":"And more that shall befall; innumerable ","Output":"Disturbances on earth through female snares, "}
{"Input":"This be thy just circumference, O World! ","Output":"Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth, "}
{"Input":"To dwell on even ground now with thy sons: ","Output":"Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain, "}
{"Input":"With superstitions and traditions taint, ","Output":"Left only in those written records pure, "}

{"Input":"From Man's effeminate slackness it begins, ","Output":"Said the Angel, who should better hold his place "}

{"Input":"Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain ","Output":"Of death denounced, whatever thing death be, "}
{"Input":"Or all at once; more glory will be won, ","Output":"Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold, "}
{"Input":"Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon ","Output":"Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth "}
{"Input":"Then were they known to men by various names, ","Output":"And various idols through the heathen world. "}
{"Input":"And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King ","Output":"Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, "}

{"Input":"Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. ","Output":"So spake the Son, and into terrour changed "}
{"Input":"The utmost border of his kingdom, left ","Output":"To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps, "}
{"Input":"With me in secret that my womb conceived ","Output":"A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, "}
{"Input":"Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird ","Output":"Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid "}

{"Input":"Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine ","Output":"Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps "}
{"Input":"Directed in devotion, to adore ","Output":"And worship God Supreme, who made him chief "}
{"Input":"Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, ","Output":"Let this be good, whether our angry Foe "}
{"Input":"Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, ","Output":"Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!) "}
{"Input":"Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, ","Output":"Yet empty of all good wherein consists "}
{"Input":"Of Angels by imperial summons called, ","Output":"Innumerable before the Almighty's throne "}
{"Input":"Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state ","Output":"Inclined not, but his coming thus declared. "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Adam fervently replied. ","Output":"O Woman, best are all things as the will "}
{"Input":"That of so many myriads fallen, yet one ","Output":"Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill "}
{"Input":"Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills ","Output":"Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not "}
{"Input":"To found this nether empire, which might rise, ","Output":"By policy and long process of time, "}
{"Input":"As from unrest; and, each the other viewing, ","Output":"Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds "}
{"Input":"His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles: ","Output":"Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den, "}
{"Input":"Their proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit, ","Output":"Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends "}
{"Input":"To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale ","Output":"Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose: "}
{"Input":"Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars; ","Output":"Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace, "}
{"Input":"Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. ","Output":"Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve "}
{"Input":"Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware, ","Output":"Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm, "}
{"Input":"Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail, ","Output":"Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood, "}
{"Input":"Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, ","Output":"Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, "}
{"Input":"In other part stood one who, at the forge ","Output":"Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass "}
{"Input":"Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams; ","Output":"Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint "}
{"Input":"The Maker's high magnificence, who built ","Output":"So spacious, and his line stretched out so far; "}
{"Input":"Save what by frugal storing firmness gains ","Output":"To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: "}
{"Input":" Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud ","Output":" Of anger shall remain, but peace assured "}
{"Input":"He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky ","Output":"Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing "}
{"Input":"After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight ","Output":"The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour, "}
{"Input":"Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo, ","Output":"This annual humbling certain numbered days, "}
{"Input":"To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day, ","Output":"Created mute to all articulate sound: "}
{"Input":"Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea, ","Output":"And all the riches of this world enjoyedst, "}
{"Input":"High, and remote to see from thence distinct ","Output":"Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps "}

{"Input":"Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know ","Output":"What misery the inabstinence of Eve "}
{"Input":"Secret they finished, and in order set, ","Output":"With silent circumspection, unespied. "}
{"Input":"Love hath abounded more than glory abounds; ","Output":"Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt "}
{"Input":"And they, who to be sure of Paradise, ","Output":"Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick, "}
{"Input":"Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end ","Output":"Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued "}
{"Input":"Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe, ","Output":"Moved contrary with thwart obliquities; "}
{"Input":"Original: while Adam took no thought, ","Output":"Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate "}
{"Input":"Fell with us from on high. From them I go ","Output":"This uncouth errand sole, and one for all "}
{"Input":"Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste ","Output":"The savour of death from all things there that live: "}
{"Input":"Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed, ","Output":"Single or in array of battle ranged "}
{"Input":"Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased; ","Output":"And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone, "}
{"Input":"In shape and gesture proudly eminent, ","Output":"Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost "}
{"Input":"Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange ","Output":"Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall, "}
{"Input":"If these magnifick titles yet remain ","Output":"Not merely titular, since by decree "}
{"Input":"To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed ","Output":"Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue, "}
{"Input":"His own: for neither do the Spirits damned ","Output":"Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast "}
{"Input":"Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on-- ","Output":"Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell "}
{"Input":"For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please ","Output":"True appetite, and not disrelish thirst "}
{"Input":"As battle hath adjudged; from this new world ","Output":"Retiring, by his own doom alienated; "}
{"Input":"Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve ","Output":"The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek "}
{"Input":"This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, ","Output":"And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; "}

{"Input":"Us to abolish, lest the Adversary ","Output":"Triumph, and say; \"Fickle their state whom God "}
{"Input":"So dearly to redeem what hellish hate ","Output":"So easily destroyed, and still destroys "}
{"Input":"Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. ","Output":"Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, "}
{"Input":"Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains, ","Output":"Lowly they bowed adoring, and began "}
{"Input":"They saw, but other sight instead! a croud ","Output":"Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell, "}
{"Input":"Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God ","Output":"They first re-edify; and for a while "}
{"Input":"For which to strive, no strife can grow up there ","Output":"From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell "}
{"Input":"Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; ","Output":"He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime "}
{"Input":"Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets ","Output":"A vast vacuity. All unawares, "}
{"Input":"Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat ","Output":"They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke "}
{"Input":"Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust ","Output":"All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings "}
{"Input":"Their place of rest, and Providence their guide: ","Output":"They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, "}
{"Input":"The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff, ","Output":"Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell, "}
{"Input":"As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last, ","Output":"To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet, "}
{"Input":"Of thy presumed return! event perverse! ","Output":"Thou never from that hour in Paradise "}
{"Input":"Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain, ","Output":"Both where the morning sun first warmly smote "}
{"Input":"Not what they would?  what praise could they receive? ","Output":"What pleasure I from such obedience paid, "}
{"Input":"A thing not undesirable, sometime ","Output":"Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free "}
{"Input":"Found so erroneous; thence by just event ","Output":"Found so unfortunate:  Nevertheless, "}
{"Input":"And Eve first to her husband thus began. ","Output":"Adam, well may we labour still to dress "}
{"Input":"Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd ","Output":"In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight "}
{"Input":"With diadem and scepter high advanced, ","Output":"The lower still I fall, only supreme "}
{"Input":"Of Congo, and Angola farthest south; ","Output":"Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount "}
{"Input":"To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, ","Output":"Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge "}
{"Input":"I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned ","Output":"With all perfections, so inflame my sense "}
{"Input":"Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain, ","Output":"Following his track (such was the will of Heaven) "}
{"Input":"Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern ","Output":"Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; "}
{"Input":"Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts ","Output":"Of glory; and far off his steps adore. "}
{"Input":"All things with double terrour:  On the ground ","Output":"Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft "}
{"Input":"Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then! ","Output":"Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens "}
{"Input":"Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim, ","Output":"Glared on him passing.  These were from without "}
{"Input":"To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt ","Output":"Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such, "}
{"Input":"Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub, ","Output":"Disporting, till the amorous bird of night "}
{"Input":"Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light, ","Output":"Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires, "}
{"Input":"Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace, ","Output":"Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end! "}
{"Input":"His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold: ","Output":"His place of birth a solemn Angel tells "}
{"Input":"No voice exempt, no voice but well could join ","Output":"Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven. "}
{"Input":"How provident he is; how far from thought ","Output":"To make us less, bent rather to exalt "}
{"Input":"The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might ","Output":"Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift "}
{"Input":"And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain, ","Output":"This pendent World, in bigness as a star "}
{"Input":"The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends; ","Output":"But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven "}
{"Input":"'Henceforth an individual solace dear; ","Output":"'Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim "}
{"Input":"At once the Four spread out their starry wings ","Output":"With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs "}
{"Input":"Which neither his foreknowing can prevent; ","Output":"And he the future evil shall no less "}
{"Input":"Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven. ","Output":"What sit we then projecting peace and war? "}
{"Input":"To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they ","Output":"God's image did not reverence in themselves. "}
{"Input":"And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked ","Output":"To find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night "}
{"Input":"Rural repast; permitting him the while ","Output":"Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change "}

{"Input":"Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed; ","Output":"Those argent fields more likely habitants, "}
{"Input":"Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds ","Output":"How darkened; innocence, that as a veil "}
{"Input":"To make us less, bent rather to exalt ","Output":"Our happy state, under one head more near "}
{"Input":"Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens ","Output":"To us invisible, or dimly seen "}
{"Input":"And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell ","Output":"With long reach interposed; three several ways "}
{"Input":"Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, ","Output":"Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. "}

{"Input":"But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, ","Output":"Obedience to the law of God, imposed "}
{"Input":"Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. ","Output":"So saying, on he led his radiant files, "}
{"Input":"With joy and acclamations loud, that one, ","Output":"That of so many myriads fallen, yet one "}
{"Input":"With Angels may participate, and find ","Output":"No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare; "}
{"Input":"Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds ","Output":"The river-dragon tamed at length submits "}
{"Input":"Vice for itself. To him no temple stood ","Output":"Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he "}
{"Input":"With travel difficult, not better far ","Output":"Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch, "}
{"Input":"Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; ","Output":"Neither our own, but given:  What folly then "}
{"Input":"On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest, ","Output":"Whoever judged, the worst on me must light, "}
{"Input":"Certain my resolution is to die: ","Output":"How can I live without thee! how forego "}
{"Input":"The bent of nature; which he thus expressed. ","Output":"True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest; "}
{"Input":"From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit; ","Output":"From imposition of strict laws to free "}
{"Input":"Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end? ","Output":"Can he make deathless death?  That were to make "}
{"Input":"Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue ","Output":"Organick, or impulse of vocal air, "}
{"Input":"And God created the great whales, and each ","Output":"Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously "}
{"Input":"Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love ","Output":"Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur "}
{"Input":"Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll ","Output":"With terrour through the dark aereal hall. "}
{"Input":"Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed ","Output":"Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I; "}
{"Input":"But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down ","Output":"To dwell on even ground now with thy sons: "}
{"Input":"Of immortality.  So little knows ","Output":"Any, but God alone, to value right "}
{"Input":"Or, if our substance be indeed divine, ","Output":"And cannot cease to be, we are at worst "}
{"Input":"Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood, ","Output":"And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled "}

{"Input":"'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change ","Output":"'Their element, to draw the thinner air.' "}
{"Input":"My motions in him; longer than they move, ","Output":"His heart I know, how variable and vain, "}
{"Input":"In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise ","Output":"Possession of the garden; he alone, "}
{"Input":"His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit, ","Output":"Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce "}
{"Input":"And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, ","Output":"All sounds on fret by string or golden wire, "}

{"Input":"With myrtle, find what to redress till noon: ","Output":"For, while so near each other thus all day "}
{"Input":"Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down ","Output":" The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount "}
{"Input":"Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. ","Output":"Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent, "}
{"Input":"Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame ","Output":"These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight, "}
{"Input":"Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, ","Output":"Came furious down to be revenged on men, "}
{"Input":"He held it vain; awe from above had quelled ","Output":"His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh "}
{"Input":"Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find ","Output":"To our destruction, if there be in Hell "}
{"Input":"With God, who called him, in a land unknown. ","Output":"Canaan he now attains; I see his tents "}
{"Input":"Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air ","Output":"Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. "}
{"Input":"Our enemy, our own loss how repair, ","Output":"How overcome this dire calamity, "}
{"Input":"To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within; ","Output":"And, in a troubled sea of passion tost, "}
{"Input":"Cherubick waving fires:  On the other part, ","Output":"Satan with his rebellious disappeared, "}
{"Input":"But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven ","Output":"Distended, as the brow of God appeased? "}
{"Input":"Still glorious before whom awake I stood: ","Output":"Who stooping opened my left side, and took "}
{"Input":"And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared ","Output":"By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last, "}
{"Input":" All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend, ","Output":" Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied. "}
{"Input":"In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed ","Output":"All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest; "}
{"Input":"So far remote, with diminution seen, ","Output":"First in his east the glorious lamp was seen, "}
{"Input":"In various shapes old Proteus from the sea, ","Output":"Drained through a limbeck to his native form. "}
{"Input":"Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven ","Output":"To those apostates; lest the like befall "}
{"Input":"As each divided legion might have seemed ","Output":"A numerous host; in strength each armed hand "}
{"Input":"Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best ","Output":"Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false "}
{"Input":"An eager appetite, raised by the smell ","Output":"So savoury of that fruit, which with desire, "}
{"Input":"Oft he to her his charge of quick return ","Output":"Repeated; she to him as oft engaged "}
{"Input":"Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain, ","Output":"Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly, "}
{"Input":"Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped ","Output":"The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: "}
{"Input":"This world's material mould, came to a heap: ","Output":"Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar "}
{"Input":"Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare. ","Output":"Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved "}
{"Input":"Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute: ","Output":"Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed, "}
{"Input":"To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet, ","Output":"Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils: "}
{"Input":"Of painful superstition and blind zeal, ","Output":"Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find "}
{"Input":"Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. ","Output":"Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round, "}
{"Input":"Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front ","Output":"Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise "}
{"Input":"The griding sword with discontinuous wound ","Output":"Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed, "}
{"Input":"Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down ","Output":"Into this Deep; and in the general fall "}
{"Input":"Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance, ","Output":"Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold; "}
{"Input":"The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, ","Output":"Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen; "}
{"Input":"The more it seems excess, that led thee hither ","Output":"From thy empyreal mansion thus alone, "}
{"Input":"To the subjected plain; then disappeared. ","Output":"They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld "}
{"Input":"Than miserable to have eternal being!-- ","Output":"Or, if our substance be indeed divine, "}
{"Input":"The aspiring Dominations:  Thou that day ","Output":"Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare, "}
{"Input":"Defeated of his seisure many days ","Output":"Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent, "}
{"Input":"Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence ","Output":"Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will "}
{"Input":"But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun ","Output":"His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope "}
{"Input":"Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased; ","Output":"Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become "}
{"Input":"How much more, if we pray him, will his ear ","Output":"Be open, and his heart to pity incline, "}
{"Input":"Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice ","Output":"Forbidding; and at once with him they rose. "}
{"Input":"From Hermon east to the great western Sea; ","Output":"Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold "}
{"Input":"The western point, where those half-rounding guards ","Output":"Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, "}
{"Input":"By sacred unction, thy deserved right. ","Output":"Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might; "}
{"Input":"The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft ","Output":"Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing, "}
{"Input":"Of him so lately promised to thy aid, ","Output":"The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold, "}
{"Input":"Against us this deceit:  To crush his head ","Output":"Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost "}

{"Input":"Their distance argues, and their swift return ","Output":"Diurnal,) merely to officiate light "}
{"Input":"Though full of pain, this intellectual being, ","Output":"Those thoughts that wander through eternity, "}
{"Input":"Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed ","Output":"That might determine, and not need repeat, "}
{"Input":"Had rounded still the horizon, and not known ","Output":"Or east or west; which had forbid the snow "}
{"Input":"To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, ","Output":"Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent, "}

{"Input":"The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on ","Output":"In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands, "}
{"Input":"Innumerable force of Spirits armed, ","Output":"That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, "}
{"Input":"If such affront I labour to avert ","Output":"From thee alone, which on us both at once "}

{"Input":"Reach also of the tree of life, and eat, ","Output":"And live for ever, dream at least to live "}
{"Input":"With joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length ","Output":"Their ministry performed, and race well run, "}
{"Input":"A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins ","Output":"Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire, "}
{"Input":"Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly ","Output":"He held it vain; awe from above had quelled "}
{"Input":"Superiour and unmoved; here only weak ","Output":"Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance. "}
{"Input":"Shall I appear? shall I to him make known ","Output":"As yet my change, and give him to partake "}
{"Input":"On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build: ","Output":"Part loosely wing the region, part more wise "}
{"Input":"Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired; ","Output":"For who can think submission? War, then, war "}
{"Input":"Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime, ","Output":"Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed "}

{"Input":"Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat ","Output":"Of various influence foment and warm, "}
{"Input":"Gladly into the ways of God with Man: ","Output":"For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set "}

{"Input":"Part loosely wing the region, part more wise ","Output":"In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way, "}
{"Input":"Merciful over all his works, with good ","Output":"Still overcoming evil, and by small "}
{"Input":"Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed ","Output":"Sown with contrition in his heart, than those "}
{"Input":"Of this round world:  With pins of adamant ","Output":"And chains they made all fast, too fast they made "}
{"Input":"And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end ","Output":"Created; but henceforth my early care, "}
{"Input":"Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight ","Output":"Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue "}
{"Input":"But prayer against his absolute decree ","Output":"No more avails than breath against the wind, "}
{"Input":"Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death ","Output":"Bind us with after-bands, what profits then "}
{"Input":"Brought death into the World, and all our woe, ","Output":"With loss of Eden, till one greater Man "}
{"Input":"O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, ","Output":"Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own; "}

{"Input":"By doom of battle, and complain that Fate ","Output":"Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance. "}
{"Input":"Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name ","Output":"Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance, "}

{"Input":"Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised ","Output":"From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid. "}
{"Input":"And send him from the garden forth to till ","Output":"The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil. "}
{"Input":"Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed ","Output":"With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled "}

{"Input":"How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, ","Output":"Measured this transient world, the race of time, "}
{"Input":"And grace that won who saw to wish her stay, ","Output":"Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers, "}
{"Input":" Glad to be offered, he attends the will ","Output":" Of his great Father. Admiration seized "}
{"Input":"With incense, I thy priest before thee bring; ","Output":"Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed "}
{"Input":"They led him high applauded, and present ","Output":"Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice, "}
{"Input":"Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. ","Output":"And I will place within them as a guide, "}
{"Input":"To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up, ","Output":"And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; "}
{"Input":"Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way; ","Output":"Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed, "}

{"Input":"Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed, ","Output":"Doubt might beget of diabolick power "}
{"Input":"Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail. ","Output":"As when a gryphon through the wilderness "}
{"Input":"(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense) ","Output":"Others apart sat on a hill retired, "}
{"Input":"Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far ","Output":"Down to this habitable, which returns "}
{"Input":"Glory of him that made them to transform ","Output":"Oft to the image of a brute, adorned "}
{"Input":"His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect; ","Output":"And season him thy last and sweetest prey. "}

{"Input":"This happy trial of thy love, which else ","Output":"So eminently never had been known? "}
{"Input":"Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. ","Output":"Therefore so abject is their punishment, "}
{"Input":"Her stores were opened, and this firmament ","Output":"Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire, "}
{"Input":"Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear ","Output":"More than enough, that temperance may be tried: "}
{"Input":"Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise ","Output":"Of something not unseasonable to ask, "}
{"Input":"At loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves ","Output":"They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe; "}
{"Input":"Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd ","Output":"Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love "}
{"Input":"Soon as they forth were come to open sight ","Output":"Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen, "}
{"Input":"The balm of life.  To whom our ancestor. ","Output":"Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong "}
{"Input":"Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage, ","Output":"And tempt not these; but hasten to appease "}

{"Input":"What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope ","Output":"Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste "}
{"Input":"Inextricable, or strict necessity: ","Output":"Our voluntary service he requires, "}
{"Input":"Yet not till the Creator from his work ","Output":"Desisting, though unwearied, up returned, "}
{"Input":"Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear ","Output":"To filial; works of law to works of faith. "}
{"Input":"Encroached on still through our intestine broils ","Output":"Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell, "}
{"Input":"Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed ","Output":"Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest "}

{"Input":"Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard ","Output":"For Gods, and too unequal work we find, "}
{"Input":"Of all their virtue:  Silent, and in face ","Output":"Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute: "}
{"Input":"Immediately inordinate desires, ","Output":"And upstart passions, catch the government "}

{"Input":"Or much more grievous pain?--Ye have the account ","Output":"Of my performance:  What remains, ye Gods, "}
{"Input":"Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed ","Output":"The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. "}
{"Input":"Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, ","Output":"Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round "}
{"Input":"Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft ","Output":"His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground, "}
{"Input":"I have received, to answer thy desire ","Output":"Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain "}
{"Input":"So much delights me, as those graceful acts, ","Output":"Those thousand decencies, that daily flow "}
{"Input":"Hermione and Cadmus, or the god ","Output":"In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed "}
{"Input":"In posture to displode their second tire ","Output":"Of thunder:  Back defeated to return "}
{"Input":"Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know? ","Output":"Can it be death?  And do they only stand "}
{"Input":"'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.' ","Output":"So saying, by the hand he took me raised, "}
{"Input":"Far otherwise the event; not death, but life ","Output":"Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys, "}
{"Input":"That God vouchsafes to raise another world ","Output":"From him, and all his anger to forget. "}
{"Input":"Busiris and his Memphian chivalry, ","Output":"While with perfidious hatred they pursued "}

{"Input":"Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good; ","Output":"And light from darkness by the hemisphere "}
{"Input":"As whom the fables name of monstrous size, ","Output":"Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove, "}

{"Input":"Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns ","Output":"Their phalanx, and began to hem him round "}
{"Input":"Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees ","Output":"In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides. "}
{"Input":"Into this cursed world a woeful race, ","Output":"That after wretched life must be at last "}
{"Input":"He added not; for Adam at the news ","Output":"Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, "}
{"Input":"Mankind created, and for him this world. ","Output":"So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear; "}
{"Input":"Will arrogate dominion undeserved ","Output":"Over his brethren, and quite dispossess "}
{"Input":"Her loveliness, so absolute she seems ","Output":"And in herself complete, so well to know "}
{"Input":"Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube ","Output":"Training his devilish enginery, impaled "}
{"Input":"Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell ","Output":"Long time in peace, by families and tribes, "}
{"Input":"With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called ","Output":"Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned "}
{"Input":"Learn how their greatest monuments of fame ","Output":"And strength, and art, are easily outdone "}
{"Input":"At random yielded up to their misrule; ","Output":"And know not that I called, and drew them thither, "}
{"Input":"Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth; ","Output":"Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills "}
{"Input":"Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire. ","Output":"Nathless he so endured, till on the beach "}
{"Input":"Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race ","Output":"Growing into a nation, and now grown "}
{"Input":"For good unknown sure is not had; or, had ","Output":"And yet unknown, is as not had at all. "}
{"Input":"And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; ","Output":"Since, through experience of this great event, "}

{"Input":"Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. ","Output":"He on his impious foes right onward drove, "}
{"Input":"Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans ","Output":"For wings, and smallest lineaments exact "}
{"Input":"That, to the height of this great argument, ","Output":"I may assert Eternal Providence, "}
{"Input":"Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess, ","Output":"The credit of whose virtue rest with thee; "}
{"Input":"So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell ","Output":"Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock "}
{"Input":"Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace, ","Output":"Total they mix, union of pure with pure "}
{"Input":"Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows ","Output":"Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit "}
{"Input":"Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort, ","Output":"In might though wonderous and in acts of war, "}
{"Input":"Far separate, circling thy holy mount, ","Output":"Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, "}
{"Input":"Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame ","Output":"Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood "}

{"Input":"Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now ","Output":"Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, "}
{"Input":"Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn ","Output":"With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere, "}
{"Input":"Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw ","Output":"What further would be learned.  Live while ye may, "}

{"Input":"Up to a better covenant; disciplined ","Output":"From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit; "}
{"Input":"But I should ill become this throne, O Peers, ","Output":"And this imperial sovereignty, adorned "}
{"Input":"By this new-felt attraction and instinct. ","Output":"Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon. "}
{"Input":"Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared; ","Output":"Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. "}
{"Input":"While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright ","Output":"Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns "}
{"Input":"Precedence; none whose portion is so small ","Output":"Of present pain that with ambitious mind "}
{"Input":"Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing ","Output":"Scout far and wide into the realm of Night, "}
{"Input":"Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest; ","Output":"As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed. "}
{"Input":"On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe; ","Output":"Me, me only, just object of his ire! "}

{"Input":"Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire, ","Output":"Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat "}
{"Input":"So since into his church lewd hirelings climb. ","Output":"Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, "}
{"Input":"Waited with hellish rancour imminent ","Output":"To intercept thy way, or send thee back "}
{"Input":"Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went ","Output":"Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, "}
{"Input":"And took their seats; till from his throne supreme ","Output":"The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will. "}
{"Input":"These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, ","Output":"And on their naked limbs the flowery roof "}
{"Input":"By likening spiritual to corporal forms, ","Output":"As may express them best; though what if Earth "}
{"Input":"To sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard ","Output":"Now walking in the garden, by soft winds "}
{"Input":"Him followed, issuing forth to the open field, ","Output":"Where all yet left of that revolted rout, "}
{"Input":"Then commune, how that day they best may ply ","Output":"Their growing work: for much their work out-grew "}
{"Input":"Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, ","Output":"Confounded, though immortal. But his doom "}
{"Input":"In India East or West, or middle shore ","Output":"In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where "}
{"Input":"Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay? ","Output":"Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived "}
{"Input":"His fallen condition is, and to me owe ","Output":"All his deliverance, and to none but me. "}
{"Input":"Nathless he so endured, till on the beach ","Output":"Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called "}
{"Input":"But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst ","Output":"The only righteous in a world preverse, "}
{"Input":"Into this Deep; and in the general fall ","Output":"I also: at which time this powerful key "}
{"Input":"His free will, to her own inclining left ","Output":"In even scale.  But fallen he is; and now "}

{"Input":"If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, ","Output":"But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire. "}

{"Input":"Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, ","Output":"Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress, "}
{"Input":"Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; ","Output":"Even shame, the last of evils; of the first "}

{"Input":"The power of the Most High:  He shall ascend ","Output":"The throne hereditary, and bound his reign "}
{"Input":"And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now ","Output":"Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed "}

{"Input":"Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured ","Output":"With scent of living carcasses designed "}
{"Input":"From their foundations loosening to and fro, ","Output":"They plucked the seated hills, with all their load, "}
{"Input":"Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait, ","Output":"Tempest the ocean: there leviathan, "}

{"Input":"Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance ","Output":"Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay "}
{"Input":"I was at first as other beasts that graze ","Output":"The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, "}

{"Input":"From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight, ","Output":"This greeting on thy impious crest receive. "}
{"Input":"The sixth, and of creation last, arose ","Output":"With evening harps and matin; when God said, "}
{"Input":"Compare above all living creatures dear! ","Output":"Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed, "}
{"Input":"Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, ","Output":"Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets, "}
{"Input":"Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears, ","Output":"And longer will delay to hear thee tell "}

{"Input":"Transformed: but he my inbred enemy ","Output":"Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, "}
{"Input":"Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild. ","Output":"Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign "}
{"Input":"Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took, ","Output":"Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side "}
{"Input":"So wonderously was set his station bright. ","Output":"There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps "}
{"Input":"And, to the faithful, death the gate of life; ","Output":"Taught this by his example, whom I now "}
{"Input":"Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: ","Output":"When out of hope, behold her, not far off, "}
{"Input":"Most reason is that reason overcome. ","Output":"So pondering, and from his armed peers "}
{"Input":"Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, ","Output":"With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power "}
{"Input":"Home to my breast, and to my memory ","Output":"His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe; "}

{"Input":"Enjoyed by us excites his envy more; ","Output":"Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side "}
{"Input":"On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse ","Output":"From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth "}
{"Input":"To meek submission: thou, at season fit, ","Output":"Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard; "}

{"Input":"Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, ","Output":"A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog "}
{"Input":"Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps ","Output":"May have diverted from continual watch "}
{"Input":"Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care ","Output":"Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows "}
{"Input":"With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals ","Output":"Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales, "}

{"Input":"From him who, in the happy realms of light ","Output":"Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine "}
{"Input":"Sin opening; who thus now to Death began. ","Output":"O Son, why sit we here each other viewing "}

{"Input":"Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks ","Output":"Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek "}
{"Input":"Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered ","Output":"With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. "}
{"Input":"Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure, ","Output":"Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen "}
{"Input":"Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds ","Output":"Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God "}
{"Input":"Less attributed to her faith sincere, ","Output":"Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed. "}
{"Input":"These tidings carry to the anointed King; ","Output":"And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. "}
{"Input":"And all who under me their banners wave, ","Output":"Homeward, with flying march, where we possess "}
{"Input":"Of contumacy will provoke the Highest ","Output":"To make death in us live:  Then let us seek "}

{"Input":"Thee also happier, shall not be withheld ","Output":"Thy hearing; such commission from above "}
{"Input":"To him with swift ascent he up returned, ","Output":"Into his blissful bosom reassumed "}
{"Input":"Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue ","Output":"Of Angels, can relate, or to what things "}
{"Input":"Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar ","Output":"Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined; "}
{"Input":"I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour, ","Output":"At feed or fountain, never had I found. "}

{"Input":"Than time or motion, but to human ears ","Output":"Cannot without process of speech be told, "}
{"Input":"From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet; ","Output":"And with desire to languish without hope, "}
{"Input":"Possession of the garden; he alone, ","Output":"To find where Adam sheltered, took his way, "}
{"Input":"We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built ","Output":"Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: "}
{"Input":"Nor solid might resist that edge: it met ","Output":"The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite "}
{"Input":"Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised ","Output":"By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers "}
{"Input":"Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce: ","Output":"All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide "}
{"Input":"Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved, ","Output":"Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. "}
{"Input":"These have their course to finish round the earth, ","Output":"By morrow evening, and from land to land "}
{"Input":"Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged ","Output":"The black tartareous cold infernal dregs, "}
{"Input":"By prayer the offended Deity to appease; ","Output":"Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart; "}

{"Input":"If answerable style I can obtain ","Output":"Of my celestial patroness, who deigns "}
{"Input":"From granting he, as I from begging, peace; ","Output":"All hope excluded thus, behold, in stead "}
{"Input":"Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on; ","Output":"In me is no delay; with thee to go, "}

{"Input":"Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay ","Output":"Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit "}
{"Input":"In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed ","Output":"A race of upstart creatures, to supply "}

{"Input":"Far less I now lament for one whole world ","Output":"Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice "}
{"Input":"Attentive, and with more delighted ear, ","Output":"Divine instructer, I have heard, than when "}
{"Input":"Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields ","Output":"In India East or West, or middle shore "}
{"Input":"Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. ","Output":"Beyond this flood a frozen continent "}

{"Input":"Left for repentance, none for pardon left? ","Output":"None left but by submission; and that word "}
{"Input":"Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill ","Output":"Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed; "}
{"Input":"He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon ","Output":"Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds "}
{"Input":"Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys ","Output":"Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change "}
{"Input":"When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, ","Output":"Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad. "}

{"Input":"Of alienated Judah. Next came one ","Output":"Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark "}
{"Input":"What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen, ","Output":"Tending to some relief of our extremes, "}
{"Input":"Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down ","Output":"The dark descent, and up to re-ascend, "}

{"Input":"Which we, in our appointed work employed, ","Output":"Have finished, happy in our mutual help "}
{"Input":"Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow. ","Output":"Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys, "}
{"Input":"If he opposed, and with ambitious aim ","Output":"Against the throne and monarchy of God, "}
{"Input":"O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred ","Output":"For what God, after better, worse would build? "}
{"Input":"A mighty nation; and upon him shower ","Output":"His benediction so, that in his seed "}
{"Input":"This tumult, and permitted all, advised: ","Output":"That his great purpose he might so fulfil, "}
{"Input":"What misery the inabstinence of Eve ","Output":"Shall bring on Men.  Immediately a place "}
{"Input":"Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence ","Output":"Unseen amid the throng: so violence "}
{"Input":"Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread ","Output":"All generations; and had hither come "}
{"Input":"Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. ","Output":"But thou hast promised from us two a race "}
{"Input":"Of God Most High: so God with Man unites! ","Output":"Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise "}
{"Input":"Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof, ","Output":"And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, "}
{"Input":"O, had his powerful destiny ordained ","Output":"Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood "}
{"Input":"There they their fill of love and love's disport ","Output":"Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal, "}
{"Input":"Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake; ","Output":"My tongue obeyed, and readily could name "}
{"Input":"Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain ","Output":"The sound of blustering winds, which all night long "}
{"Input":"My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here, ","Output":"Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude, "}
{"Input":"Me, now your curse!  Ah, why should all mankind, ","Output":"For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned, "}
{"Input":"Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; ","Output":"Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out "}
{"Input":"To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound ","Output":"Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used "}
{"Input":"Which else might work him danger or delay: ","Output":"And now a stripling Cherub he appears, "}
{"Input":"Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape. ","Output":"Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed, "}
{"Input":"Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks ","Output":"That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked "}
{"Input":"For such a petty trespass? and not praise ","Output":"Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain "}
{"Input":"Till at his second bidding Darkness fled, ","Output":"Light shone, and order from disorder sprung: "}
{"Input":"Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, ","Output":"And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse "}
{"Input":"A vast vacuity. All unawares, ","Output":"Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops "}
{"Input":"Not longer than since I, in one night, freed ","Output":"From servitude inglorious well nigh half "}
{"Input":"Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise; ","Output":"And to the Woman thus his sentence turned. "}
{"Input":" Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce ","Output":" He marked and mad demeanour, then alone, "}
{"Input":"She gave him of that fair enticing fruit ","Output":"With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat, "}
{"Input":"Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind, ","Output":"Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true, "}
{"Input":"Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news ","Output":"From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased "}
{"Input":"Luxurious by restraint; what we by day ","Output":"Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, "}
{"Input":"Lest, thou not tasting, different degree ","Output":"Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce "}
{"Input":"\"He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?\" ","Output":"Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe. "}
{"Input":"That brought me on a sudden to the tree ","Output":"Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed, "}
{"Input":"Exacts our parting hence; and see!the guards, ","Output":"By me encamped on yonder hill, expect "}
{"Input":"Under his great vice-gerent reign abide ","Output":"United, as one individual soul, "}
{"Input":"Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith ","Output":"Rarely be found:  So shall the world go on, "}
{"Input":"She gave me of the tree, and I did eat. ","Output":"To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied. "}
{"Input":"But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods. ","Output":"Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, "}
{"Input":"Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main. ","Output":"Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; "}
{"Input":"Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts ","Output":"Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. "}
{"Input":"Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part ","Output":"And person, hadst thou known thyself aright. "}
{"Input":"Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off, ","Output":"In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge, "}
{"Input":"Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained: ","Output":"God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top "}
{"Input":"Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used ","Output":"Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained "}
{"Input":"He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first ","Output":"To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed; "}
{"Input":"Which I must keep till my appointed day ","Output":"Of rendering up, and patiently attend "}
{"Input":"His own works and their works at once to view: ","Output":"About him all the Sanctities of Heaven "}
{"Input":"'Of fish within their watery residence, ","Output":"'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change "}
{"Input":"Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy, ","Output":"And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy, "}

{"Input":"And summons read, the great consult began. ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit. ","Output":"If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell "}

{"Input":"Of that infernal court. But far within, ","Output":"And in their own dimensions like themselves, "}
{"Input":"Thus they in mutual accusation spent ","Output":"The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning; "}
{"Input":"Not to be trusted; longing to be seen, ","Output":"Though by the Devil himself; him overweening "}
{"Input":"Begirt with British and Armoric knights; ","Output":"And all who since, baptized or infidel, "}
{"Input":"To whose bright image nigntly by the moon ","Output":"Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs; "}
{"Input":"Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice. ","Output":"Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned "}
{"Input":"Fermented the great mother to conceive, ","Output":"Satiate with genial moisture; when God said, "}
{"Input":"And these inferiour far beneath me set? ","Output":"Among unequals what society "}
{"Input":"To union, and firm faith, and firm accord, ","Output":"More than can be in Heaven, we now return "}
{"Input":"Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, ","Output":"Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! "}
{"Input":"Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree ","Output":"All other beasts that saw, with like desire "}
{"Input":"Immense I have transfused, that all may know ","Output":"In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare; "}
{"Input":"Abortive, to torment me ere their being, ","Output":"With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek "}
{"Input":"The universal Maker we may praise; ","Output":"Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes "}
{"Input":"First thy obedience; the other who can know, ","Output":"Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? "}
{"Input":"Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; ","Output":"That they may have their wish, to try with me "}
{"Input":"To brute denied, and are of love the food; ","Output":"Love, not the lowest end of human life. "}
{"Input":"As not behind in hate, if what was urged ","Output":"Main reason to persuade immediate war "}
{"Input":"So eminently never had been known? ","Output":"Were it I thought death menaced would ensue "}
{"Input":"Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair, ","Output":"Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring, "}
{"Input":"His eye surveyed the dark idolatries ","Output":"Of alienated Judah. Next came one "}
{"Input":"The high injunction, not to taste that fruit, ","Output":"Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, "}
{"Input":"Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill, ","Output":"Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt; "}
{"Input":"His image who made both, and less expressing ","Output":"The character of that dominion given "}
{"Input":"Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged; ","Output":"How much more, if we pray him, will his ear "}
{"Input":"But is there yet no other way, besides ","Output":"These painful passages, how we may come "}
{"Input":"Before thy fellows, ambitious to win ","Output":"From me some plume, that thy success may show "}
{"Input":"Hugest of living creatures, on the deep ","Output":"Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims, "}
{"Input":"Over all other creatures that possess ","Output":"Earth, air, and sea.  Then let us not think hard "}
{"Input":"Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound ","Output":"Or taint integrity:  But all obeyed "}
{"Input":"On golden hinges turning, as by work ","Output":"Divine the sovran Architect had framed. "}
{"Input":"The story heard attentive, and was filled ","Output":"With admiration and deep muse, to hear "}
{"Input":"So spake the Fiend, and with necessity, ","Output":"The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds. "}
{"Input":"Slowly descended, and with right aspect ","Output":"Against the eastern gate of Paradise "}
{"Input":"In Paradise of all things common else! ","Output":"By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men "}
{"Input":" ","Output":"All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued, "}
{"Input":"Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts ","Output":"Created him endowed; with happiness, "}
{"Input":"Far was advanced on winged speed; an host ","Output":"Innumerable as the stars of night, "}
{"Input":"Admonished by his ear, and straight was known ","Output":"The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven "}
{"Input":"Thus answered:--\"Leader of those armies bright ","Output":"Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled! "}

{"Input":"Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. ","Output":"In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? "}
{"Input":"And chains they made all fast, too fast they made ","Output":"And durable!  And now in little space "}
{"Input":"What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe! ","Output":"Imputest thou that to my default, or will "}
{"Input":"Had driven out the ungodly from his sight ","Output":"And the habitations of the just; to Him "}
{"Input":"Their starry dance in numbers that compute ","Output":"Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp "}

{"Input":"Of their great Potentate; for great indeed ","Output":"His name, and high was his degree in Heaven; "}
{"Input":"Of union or communion, deified: ","Output":"I, by conversing, cannot these erect "}
{"Input":"Like consort to thyself canst no where find. ","Output":"That day I oft remember, when from sleep "}

{"Input":"Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; ","Output":"Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world "}
{"Input":"From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake ","Output":"Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark, "}
{"Input":"Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep? ","Output":"What can it the avail though yet we feel "}
{"Input":"Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim ","Output":"Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes. "}
{"Input":"Light shone, and order from disorder sprung: ","Output":"Swift to their several quarters hasted then "}
{"Input":"Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd; ","Output":"Or Neptune's ire, or Juno's, that so long "}
{"Input":"But first low reverence done, as to the Power ","Output":"That dwelt within, whose presence had infused "}
{"Input":"Reflected may with matter sere foment; ","Output":"Or, by collision of two bodies, grind "}
{"Input":"O sacred name of faithfulness profaned! ","Output":"Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? "}
{"Input":"As how with peccant Angels late they saw, ","Output":"And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed. "}
{"Input":"How subtly to detain thee I devise; ","Output":"Inviting thee to hear while I relate; "}
{"Input":"So sung they, and the empyrean rung ","Output":"With halleluiahs:  Thus was sabbath kept. "}
{"Input":"Queen of this universe! do not believe ","Output":"Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die: "}
{"Input":"Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects. ","Output":"But of this tree we may not taste nor touch; "}

{"Input":"Differing but in degree, of kind the same. ","Output":"Wonder not then, what God for you saw good "}
{"Input":"How are we happy, still in fear of harm? ","Output":"But harm precedes not sin: only our foe, "}
{"Input":"As from his wit and native subtlety ","Output":"Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed, "}
{"Input":"That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth, ","Output":"Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; "}

{"Input":"Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. ","Output":"So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell "}
{"Input":"They sat them down; and, after no more toil ","Output":"Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed "}
{"Input":"That cuts us off from hope; and savours only ","Output":"Rancour and pride, impatience and despite, "}
{"Input":"What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse ","Output":"Repeated, and indecent overthrow "}
{"Input":"His beams, unactive else, their vigour find. ","Output":"Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries "}

{"Input":"With noises loud and ruinous (to compare ","Output":"Great things with small) than when Bellona storms "}
{"Input":"New part puts on; and, as to passion moved, ","Output":"Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act "}
{"Input":"Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel; ","Output":"Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed "}
{"Input":"Or longitude,) where the great luminary ","Output":"Aloof the vulgar constellations thick, "}
{"Input":"The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong; ","Output":"But long ere our approaching heard within "}
{"Input":"Argue thy inexperience what behoves ","Output":"From hard assays and ill successes past "}
{"Input":"Cursed his creation;  Death as oft accused ","Output":"Of tardy execution, since denounced "}
{"Input":"Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn, ","Output":"And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake. "}
{"Input":"Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long ","Output":"Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest; "}
{"Input":"Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed, ","Output":"Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai, "}
{"Input":"Discursive, or intuitive; discourse ","Output":"Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, "}
{"Input":"Be good and friendly still, and oft return! ","Output":"So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven "}
{"Input":"His legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced ","Output":"Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks "}
{"Input":"The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat. ","Output":"Which when the Lord God heard, without delay "}
{"Input":"And left large field, unsafe within the wind ","Output":"Of such commotion; such as, to set forth "}
{"Input":"Pansies, and violets, and asphodel, ","Output":"And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap. "}
{"Input":"Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part, ","Output":"Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. "}
{"Input":"O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed, ","Output":"Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall "}
{"Input":"And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh, ","Output":"And without whom am to no end, my guide "}
{"Input":"Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found ","Output":"No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale "}
{"Input":"For thither he assembled all his train, ","Output":"Pretending so commanded to consult "}
{"Input":"Happier! had it sufficed him to have known ","Output":"Good by itself, and evil not at all. "}
{"Input":"Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? ","Output":"Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. "}
{"Input":"Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear? ","Output":"To whom with healing words Adam replied. "}
{"Input":"Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success, ","Output":"Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel; "}
{"Input":"Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar. ","Output":"Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell! "}
{"Input":"Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge ","Output":"Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied. "}
{"Input":"Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought? ","Output":"Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid "}

{"Input":"Torment with ease, and soonest recompense ","Output":"Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; "}
{"Input":"The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines, ","Output":"And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool: "}
{"Input":"Rape or adultery, where passing fair ","Output":"Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils. "}
{"Input":"Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes. ","Output":"He ended, and the heavenly audience loud "}
{"Input":"One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven ","Output":"By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled "}
{"Input":"Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud ","Output":"Weening to prosper, and at length prevail "}
{"Input":"Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms, ","Output":"Limbed and full grown:  Out of the ground up rose, "}
{"Input":"How little weight my words with thee can find, ","Output":"Found so erroneous; thence by just event "}
{"Input":"Thence to behold this new created world, ","Output":"The addition of his empire, how it showed "}
{"Input":" Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm, ","Output":" A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend, "}
{"Input":"Rancour and pride, impatience and despite, ","Output":"Reluctance against God and his just yoke "}
{"Input":"Immoveable of this now fenceless world, ","Output":"Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, "}
{"Input":"Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed ","Output":"Like things to like; the rest to several place "}
{"Input":"In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw ","Output":"Envy from each inferior; but who here "}
{"Input":"Their city, his temple, and his holy ark, ","Output":"With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey "}
{"Input":"O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, ","Output":"Son of my bosom, Son who art alone. "}
{"Input":"In that celestial colloquy sublime, ","Output":"As with an object that excels the sense "}
{"Input":"In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome ","Output":"Eternity so spent in worship paid "}
{"Input":"Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled. ","Output":"Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold "}
{"Input":"The one just man alive; by his command ","Output":"Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst, "}
{"Input":"Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives; ","Output":"Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man, "}
{"Input":" ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied. ","Output":"Adam, by sad experiment I know "}
{"Input":"Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear: ","Output":"This tree is not, as we are told, a tree "}
{"Input":"Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds, ","Output":"Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent "}
{"Input":"And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark ","Output":"Illumine, what is low raise and support; "}
{"Input":"Till final dissolution, wander here; ","Output":"Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed; "}
{"Input":"Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that ","Output":"Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve "}
{"Input":"Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear. ","Output":"The sun was sunk, and after him the star "}
{"Input":"A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross ","Output":"By his own nation; slain for bringing life: "}
{"Input":"Another now hath to himself engrossed ","Output":"All power, and us eclipsed under the name "}
{"Input":"Bore up his branching head:  Scarce from his mould ","Output":"Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved "}
{"Input":"A third part of the Gods, in synod met ","Output":"Their deities to assert; who, while they feel "}
{"Input":"I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher ","Output":"Would set me highest, and in a moment quit "}
{"Input":"With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame, ","Output":"But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, "}
{"Input":"Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance, ","Output":"Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour "}
{"Input":"Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel ","Output":"The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh, "}
{"Input":"My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed; ","Output":"So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: "}
{"Input":"With frontispiece of diamond and gold ","Output":"Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems "}
{"Input":"Unwary, and too desirous, as before, ","Output":"So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest "}
{"Input":"Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles ","Output":"Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy, "}
{"Input":"To us, as likely tasting to attain ","Output":"Proportional ascent; which cannot be "}
{"Input":"Simplicity and spotless innocence! ","Output":"So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight "}
{"Input":"Just confidence, and native righteousness, ","Output":"And honour, from about them, naked left "}
{"Input":"Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime, ","Output":"This essence to incarnate and imbrute, "}
{"Input":"And hunger both, from labour, at the hour ","Output":"Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, "}
{"Input":"As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm ","Output":"As Delos, floating once; the rest his look "}
{"Input":"Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse ","Output":"Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned "}
{"Input":"Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite, ","Output":"Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised "}
{"Input":"Attendant on their Lord:  Heaven opened wide ","Output":"Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound "}
{"Input":"With pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence ","Output":"Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, "}
{"Input":"Of smallest magnitude close by the moon. ","Output":"Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge, "}
{"Input":"Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe ","Output":"As now is entered; yet no purposed foe "}
{"Input":"And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine, ","Output":"And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise, "}
{"Input":"From the sun's beam meet night, her other part ","Output":"Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light, "}
{"Input":"To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul, ","Output":"Down to the golden Chersonese; or where "}
{"Input":"What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart, ","Output":"Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine: "}
{"Input":"But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray; ","Output":"With cruel tournament the squadrons join; "}
{"Input":"Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground ","Output":"None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist "}
{"Input":"Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life ","Output":"Thereby regained, but sat devising death "}
{"Input":"With ravishment beheld! there best beheld, ","Output":"Where universally admired; but here "}
{"Input":"Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain ","Output":"To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; "}
{"Input":"What might have else to human race been hid; ","Output":"The discord which befel, and war in Heaven "}
{"Input":"But pain is perfect misery, the worst ","Output":"Of evils, and, excessive, overturns "}
{"Input":"Vapours not yet into her substance turned. ","Output":"Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale "}
{"Input":"And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King, ","Output":"I keep, by him forbidden to unlock "}
{"Input":"To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe ","Output":"Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong, "}
{"Input":"That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. ","Output":"His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed "}
{"Input":"Your fear itself of death removes the fear. ","Output":"Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe; "}
{"Input":"An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well ","Output":"Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love; "}
{"Input":"Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow, ","Output":"Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven "}
{"Input":"Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask ","Output":"Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies "}
{"Input":"Here we may reigh secure; and, in my choice, ","Output":"To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell: "}
{"Input":"Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed ","Output":"To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there "}
{"Input":"Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself ","Output":"Before me:  Woman is her name;of Man "}
{"Input":"Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. ","Output":"For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; "}
{"Input":"Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument ","Output":"Not less but more heroick than the wrath "}
{"Input":"This inaccessible high strength, the seat ","Output":"Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed, "}
{"Input":"And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. ","Output":"  All these and more came flocking; but with looks "}
{"Input":"Our purer essence then will overcome ","Output":"Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel; "}
{"Input":"Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light, ","Output":"And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds "}
{"Input":"Both his beloved Man, and all his world, ","Output":"To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, "}
{"Input":"Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne ","Output":"With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing "}
{"Input":"Should God create another Eve, and I ","Output":"Another rib afford, yet loss of thee "}
{"Input":"Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell, ","Output":"Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; "}
{"Input":"Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused, ","Output":"Their pleasant dwelling-place.  Thrice happy Men, "}
{"Input":"Greater so manifold, to this one use, ","Output":"For aught appears, and on their orbs impose "}
{"Input":"Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat ","Output":"Build in her loveliest, and create an awe "}
{"Input":"Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky, ","Output":"And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls; "}
{"Input":"That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate, ","Output":"Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed, "}
{"Input":"And from these corporal nutriments perhaps ","Output":"Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit, "}
{"Input":"Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest ","Output":"From Man or Angel the great Architect "}
{"Input":"Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise: ","Output":"But infinite in pardon was my Judge, "}
{"Input":"Relate thee!  Greater now in thy return ","Output":"Than from the giant Angels:  Thee that day "}
{"Input":"The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss ","Output":"Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch "}
{"Input":"Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? ","Output":"While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps, "}
{"Input":"Did first create your leader--next, free choice ","Output":"With what besides in council or in fight "}
{"Input":"The strife which thou callest evil, but we style ","Output":"The strife of glory; which we mean to win, "}
{"Input":"Came prologue, and apology too prompt; ","Output":"Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed. "}
{"Input":"Of horrible confusion; over which ","Output":"By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved, "}
{"Input":"Joined with me once, now misery hath joined ","Output":"In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest "}
{"Input":"Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout ","Output":"Vital in every part, not as frail man "}
{"Input":"Of hard contents, and full of force urged home; ","Output":"Such as we might perceive amused them all, "}
{"Input":"Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now ","Output":"Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined? "}
{"Input":"And judgement from above: him old and young ","Output":"Exploded, and had seized with violent hands, "}
{"Input":"With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole ","Output":"Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate; "}
{"Input":"When he who most excels in fact of arms, ","Output":"In what he counsels and in what excels "}
{"Input":"On which the sun more glad impressed his beams ","Output":"Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, "}
{"Input":"To add more sweetness; and they thus began. ","Output":"These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, "}
{"Input":"His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss: ","Output":"Direct against which opened from beneath, "}
{"Input":"Not unconformed to other shining globes, ","Output":"Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned "}
{"Input":"  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool ","Output":"His mighty stature; on each hand the flames "}
{"Input":"Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim: ","Output":"Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers, "}
{"Input":"The clasping ivy where to climb; while I, ","Output":"In yonder spring of roses intermixed "}
{"Input":"They trespass, authors to themselves in all ","Output":"Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so "}
{"Input":"Who first seduced them to that foul revolt? ","Output":"  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, "}
{"Input":"In fellowships of joy, the sons of light ","Output":"Hasted, resorting to the summons high; "}
{"Input":"Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits, ","Output":"Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired; "}
{"Input":"Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein ","Output":"Each to other like, more than on earth is thought? "}
{"Input":"When suddenly stood at my head a dream, ","Output":"Whose inward apparition gently moved "}
{"Input":"The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned ","Output":"Adam, by dire example, to beware "}
{"Input":"Intended thee; for trial only brought, ","Output":"To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet: "}
{"Input":"Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable? ","Output":"His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid, "}
{"Input":"Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed, ","Output":"Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon, "}
{"Input":"Hard liberty before the easy yoke ","Output":"Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear "}
{"Input":"Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, ","Output":"That mock our scant manuring, and require "}
{"Input":"Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way ","Output":"Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich "}
{"Input":"Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth ","Output":"In that celestial colloquy sublime, "}
{"Input":"The Cherubim descended; on the ground ","Output":"Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist "}
{"Input":"Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired. ","Output":"He ended, and his words their drooping cheer "}
{"Input":"His people from enthralment, they return, ","Output":"With glory and spoil, back to their promised land. "}
{"Input":"In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high ","Output":"Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate-- "}
{"Input":"For aught appears, and on their orbs impose ","Output":"Such restless revolution day by day "}
{"Input":"Though without number still, amidst the hall ","Output":"Of that infernal court. But far within, "}
{"Input":"By living streams among the trees of life, ","Output":"Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared, "}
{"Input":"Tormented all the air; all air seemed then ","Output":"Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale "}
{"Input":"But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell; ","Output":"That I may find him, and with secret gaze "}
{"Input":"God, as to leave them, and expose their land, ","Output":"Their city, his temple, and his holy ark, "}
{"Input":"No happier state, and know to know no more. ","Output":"Now had night measured with her shadowy cone "}
{"Input":"Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds, ","Output":"With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on "}
{"Input":"To lessen thee, against his purpose serves ","Output":"To manifest the more thy might: his evil "}
{"Input":"'With thee it came and goes: but follow me, ","Output":"'And I will bring thee where no shadow stays "}
{"Input":"Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, ","Output":"Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief. "}
{"Input":"Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest ","Output":"Powdered with stars.  And now on Earth the seventh "}
{"Input":"His chief delight and favour, him for whom ","Output":"All these his works so wonderous he ordained, "}
{"Input":"In council sat, solicitous what chance ","Output":"Might intercept their emperour sent; so he "}
{"Input":"And by her yielded, by him best received, ","Output":"Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, "}
{"Input":"We know no time when we were not as now; ","Output":"Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised "}
{"Input":"Strongly to suffer and support our pains, ","Output":"That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, "}
{"Input":"Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot. ","Output":"Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast "}
{"Input":"Created in his image, there to dwell ","Output":"And worship him; and in reward to rule "}
{"Input":"From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar ","Output":"Embowelled with outrageous noise the air, "}
{"Input":"Of happiness!--Yet well, if here would end ","Output":"The misery; I deserved it, and would bear "}
{"Input":"As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied ","Output":"Subjection, but required with gentle sway, "}
{"Input":"But, glad that now his sea should find a shore, ","Output":"With fresh alacrity and force renewed "}
{"Input":"Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less ","Output":"Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, "}
{"Input":"In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom ","Output":"Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know. "}
{"Input":"Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids-- ","Output":"His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!\" "}
{"Input":"Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass ","Output":"Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape "}
{"Input":"Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply ","Output":"By thy conception; children thou shalt bring "}
{"Input":"The great Messiah, and his new commands, ","Output":"Who speedily through all the hierarchies "}
{"Input":"Not without song, each morning, and due praise, ","Output":"Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease "}
{"Input":"The consort of his reign; and by them stood ","Output":"Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name "}
{"Input":"His flight precipitant, and winds with ease ","Output":"Through the pure marble air his oblique way "}
{"Input":"In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring ","Output":"Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew "}
{"Input":"Thou never from that hour in Paradise ","Output":"Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; "}
{"Input":"Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed ","Output":"From all her caves, and back resounded Death! "}
{"Input":"So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve, ","Output":"Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied. "}
{"Input":"Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes ","Output":"Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: "}
{"Input":"His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed ","Output":"Equal in strength, and rather than be less "}
{"Input":"And, in embraces forcible and foul ","Output":"Engendering with me, of that rape begot "}
{"Input":"Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, ","Output":"Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves "}
{"Input":"Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends ","Output":"Siege and defiance:  Wretched man!what food "}
{"Input":"Astonished. None among the choice and prime ","Output":"Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found "}
{"Input":"On her soft axle, while she paces even, ","Output":"And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along; "}
{"Input":"In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st ","Output":"Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son. "}
{"Input":"With adverse blast upturns them from the south ","Output":"Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds "}
{"Input":"But now prepare thee for another scene. ","Output":"He looked, and saw wide territory spread "}
{"Input":"And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon, ","Output":"Thus to herself she pleasingly began. "}
{"Input":"Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem ","Output":"Of our integrity: his foul esteem "}
{"Input":"Through multitude that sung:  Just are thy ways, ","Output":"Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works; "}
{"Input":"Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree ","Output":"Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; "}
{"Input":"Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun ","Output":"Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm "}
{"Input":"Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die, ","Output":"And dying rise, and rising with him raise "}
{"Input":"Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved ","Output":"Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, "}
{"Input":"Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf? ","Output":"Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!\" "}
{"Input":"Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou ","Output":"In what he gives to thee, this Paradise "}
{"Input":"Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold; ","Output":"Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise "}
{"Input":"Whose easier business were to serve their Lord ","Output":"High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, "}
{"Input":"The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs, ","Output":"Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune "}
{"Input":"His habit fit for speed succinct, and held ","Output":"Before his decent steps a silver wand. "}
{"Input":"Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way ","Output":"Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light, "}
{"Input":"While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof? ","Output":"  The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell "}
{"Input":"Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, ","Output":"And god-like imitated state: him round "}
{"Input":"Against the high supremacy of Heaven, ","Output":"Affecting God-head, and, so losing all, "}
{"Input":"Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good: ","Output":"But all that fair and good in thy divine "}
{"Input":"The waters from the waters; and God made ","Output":"The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, "}
{"Input":"That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance ","Output":"Thy miscreated front athwart my way "}
{"Input":"Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood, ","Output":"That with extended wings a bannered host, "}
{"Input":"And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb ","Output":"Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould; "}
{"Input":"Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell ","Output":"For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws. "}
{"Input":"He onward came; far off his coming shone; ","Output":"And twenty thousand (I their number heard) "}
{"Input":"Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised ","Output":"The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see "}
{"Input":"Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight, ","Output":"The bent of nature; which he thus expressed. "}
{"Input":"When Adam thus to Eve.  Fair Consort, the hour ","Output":"Of night, and all things now retired to rest, "}
{"Input":"Some advantageous act may be achieved ","Output":"By sudden onset--either with Hell-fire "}
{"Input":"Myriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league, ","Output":"United thoughts and counsels, equal hope "}
{"Input":"Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky, ","Output":"Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers, "}
{"Input":"My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth ","Output":"Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed "}
{"Input":"Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign ","Output":"What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart, "}
{"Input":"With glory attributed to the high ","Output":"Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains, "}
{"Input":" ","Output":"As one who in his journey bates at noon, "}

{"Input":"The scepter, and regard not David's sons; ","Output":"Then lose it to a stranger, that the true "}
{"Input":"Divine displeasure for her sake, or death. ","Output":"In recompence for such compliance bad "}
{"Input":"Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet, ","Output":"That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks "}
{"Input":"Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, ","Output":"Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, "}
{"Input":"Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle ","Output":"Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good; "}
{"Input":"Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd ","Output":"With his own folly?  that be from thee far, "}
{"Input":"And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words ","Output":"Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- "}
{"Input":"Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire ","Output":"To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite "}
{"Input":"This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower, ","Output":"Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands "}
{"Input":"Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air ","Output":"Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom; "}
{"Input":"To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek. ","Output":"Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, "}
{"Input":"His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought, ","Output":"Or proud return, though to his heavier doom, "}
{"Input":"Of substance, and, in things that live, of life; ","Output":"But more refined, more spiritous, and pure, "}
{"Input":"Even to the inmost seat of mental sight, ","Output":"That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes, "}
{"Input":"Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide, ","Output":"Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright, "}
{"Input":"O'er the blue firmament a radiant white, ","Output":"And slow descends with something heavenly fraught? "}
{"Input":"Of light by far the greater part he took, ","Output":"Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed "}
{"Input":"Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named ","Output":"Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem "}
{"Input":"Of God the garden was, by him in the east ","Output":"Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line "}
{"Input":"For Gods!  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes ","Output":"To call by vision, from his father's house, "}
{"Input":"In some to spring from thee; who never touched ","Output":"The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired; "}
{"Input":"Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, ","Output":"And disobedience: on the part of Heaven "}
{"Input":"Thy message, which might else in telling wound, ","Output":"And in performing end us; what besides "}
{"Input":"With impetuous recoil and jarring sound, ","Output":"Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate "}
{"Input":"This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve ","Output":"Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form "}
{"Input":"Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out ","Output":"From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep: "}
{"Input":" Though now to Death I yield, and am his due, ","Output":" All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid, "}
{"Input":"To show us in this mountain; while the winds ","Output":"Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks "}
{"Input":"By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son, ","Output":"Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top "}
{"Input":"Stay his return perhaps over this gulf ","Output":"Impassable, impervious; let us try "}
{"Input":"Till night; then in the east her turn she shines, ","Output":"Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign "}
{"Input":"Amid the waters, and let it divide ","Output":"The waters from the waters; and God made "}
{"Input":"Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken ","Output":"The empire of Negus to his utmost port "}
{"Input":"Nor so content, hath in his thought to try ","Output":"In battle, what our power is, or our right. "}
{"Input":"Of birds on every bough; so much the more ","Output":"His wonder was to find unwakened Eve "}
{"Input":"Hateful to utter. But what power of mind, ","Output":"Forseeing or presaging, from the depth "}
{"Input":"How busied, in what form and posture couched. ","Output":"To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. "}

{"Input":"O execrable son! so to aspire ","Output":"Above his brethren; to himself assuming "}
{"Input":"Our labour must be to pervert that end, ","Output":"And out of good still to find means of evil; "}

{"Input":"No despicable gift; surmise not then ","Output":"His presence to these narrow bounds confined "}
{"Input":"That were an ignominy and shame beneath ","Output":"This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, "}
{"Input":"When coming towards them so dread they saw ","Output":"The bottom of the mountains upward turned; "}
{"Input":"Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd ","Output":"All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect "}
{"Input":"Right reason for their law, and for their King ","Output":"Messiah, who by right of merit reigns. "}
{"Input":"Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue, ","Output":"Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed: "}

{"Input":"So law appears imperfect; and but given ","Output":"With purpose to resign them, in full time, "}
{"Input":"Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host ","Output":"Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring "}
{"Input":"His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim ","Output":"That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven, "}

{"Input":"Attended. All access was thronged; the gates ","Output":"And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall "}
{"Input":"  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, ","Output":"With head uplift above the wave, and eyes "}

{"Input":"Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld, ","Output":"Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim: "}
{"Input":"Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity, ","Output":"With some regard to what is just and right "}
{"Input":"By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade ","Output":"Inseparable, must with me along; "}
{"Input":"By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, ","Output":"But from the author of all ill, could spring "}
{"Input":"Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off ","Output":"From their Creator, and transgress his will "}
{"Input":"Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit, ","Output":"However chastening; to the evil turn "}
{"Input":"Inclines--here to continue, and build up here ","Output":"A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream, "}
{"Input":"Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft ","Output":"Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate, "}
{"Input":"His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal; ","Output":"Nor number, nor example, with him wrought "}
{"Input":"For prospect, what well used had been the pledge ","Output":"Of immortality.  So little knows "}
{"Input":"His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar ","Output":"His iron gates, if he intends our stay "}
{"Input":"Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank, ","Output":"Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered, "}
{"Input":"But us he sends upon his high behests ","Output":"For state, as Sovran King; and to inure "}
{"Input":"So should thy goodness and thy greatness both ","Output":"Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence. "}
{"Input":"Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars ","Output":"Up to the fiery concave towering high. "}
{"Input":"Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared ","Output":"A crew who, under names of old renown-- "}
{"Input":"Satan alighted walks:  A globe far off ","Output":"It seemed, now seems a boundless continent "}
{"Input":"And looking down, to see the hubbub strange, ","Output":"And hear the din:  Thus was the building left "}
{"Input":"That the Most High commanding, now ere night, ","Output":"Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven, "}
{"Input":"Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark, ","Output":"As from his wit and native subtlety "}
{"Input":"And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear; ","Output":"With clamour thence the rapid currents drive, "}
{"Input":"Touch of celestial temper, but returns ","Output":"Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts "}
{"Input":"Nor knowing us, nor known:  And, if by prayer ","Output":"Incessant I could hope to change the will "}
{"Input":"Tunes her nocturnal note.  Thus with the year ","Output":"Seasons return; but not to me returns "}
{"Input":"When I am present, and thy trial choose ","Output":"With me, best witness of thy virtue tried? "}
{"Input":"With glory and power to judge both quick and dead; ","Output":"To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward "}
{"Input":"Whence heavy persecution shall arise ","Output":"On all, who in the worship persevere "}
{"Input":"Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so ","Output":"I form'd them free: and free they must remain, "}
{"Input":"And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still ","Output":"But to my own conviction: first and last "}
{"Input":"For Man to tell how human life began ","Output":"Is hard; for who himself beginning knew "}
{"Input":"God is thy law, thou mine:  To know no more ","Output":"Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise. "}
{"Input":"Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes: ","Output":"From branch to branch the smaller birds with song "}
{"Input":"Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled; ","Output":"With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed. "}
{"Input":"By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock, ","Output":"A whole day's journey high, but wide remote "}
{"Input":"As when he washed his servants feet; so now, ","Output":"As father of his family, he clad "}
{"Input":"Moses once more his potent rod extends ","Output":"Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys; "}
{"Input":"Not to know me argues yourselves unknown, ","Output":"The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know, "}
{"Input":"With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance ","Output":"And easily approved; when the Most High "}
{"Input":"But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all? ","Output":"Be then his love accursed, since love or hate, "}
{"Input":"Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal ","Output":"With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form: "}
{"Input":"Opened we find indeed, and find we know ","Output":"Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got; "}
{"Input":"Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. ","Output":"Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed "}
{"Input":"Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought ","Output":"So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven, "}
{"Input":"  Nine times the space that measures day and night ","Output":"To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, "}
{"Input":"One step, no more than from himself, can fly ","Output":"By change of place:  Now conscience wakes despair, "}
{"Input":"Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained ","Output":"Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground "}
{"Input":"Self-raised, and repossess their native seat? ","Output":"For me, be witness all the host of Heaven, "}
{"Input":"And with persuasive accent thus began:-- ","Output":"  \"I should be much for open war, O Peers, "}
{"Input":"Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy ","Output":"Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.\" "}
{"Input":"Open or understood, must be resolved.\" ","Output":"  He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew "}
{"Input":"Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, ","Output":"But all these in their pregnant causes mixed "}
{"Input":"For well I understand in the prime end ","Output":"Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind "}
{"Input":"And study of revenge, immortal hate, ","Output":"And courage never to submit or yield: "}
{"Input":"With scent of living carcasses designed ","Output":"For death, the following day, in bloody fight: "}
{"Input":"Which to his eye discovers unaware ","Output":"The goodly prospect of some foreign land "}
{"Input":"Here watching at the head of these that sleep? ","Output":"Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn, "}
{"Input":"Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true, ","Output":"If true, here only, and of delicious taste: "}
{"Input":"All seasons, and their change, all please alike. ","Output":"Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, "}
{"Input":"Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields ","Output":"Various, with boastful argument portrayed, "}
{"Input":"Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine ","Output":"Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety. "}
{"Input":"In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides ","Output":"Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen, "}
{"Input":"Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point ","Output":"Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears "}
{"Input":"How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost, ","Output":"Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote! "}
{"Input":"Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud ","Output":"Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind, "}
{"Input":"Came towering, armed in adamant and gold; ","Output":"Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood "}
{"Input":"Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth ","Output":"God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven. "}
{"Input":"Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss, ","Output":"And all his people; thunder mixed with hail, "}
{"Input":"They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime, ","Output":"With clang despised the ground, under a cloud "}
{"Input":"But if thou judge it hard and difficult, ","Output":"Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain "}
{"Input":"Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn ","Output":"Us, haply too secure, of our discharge "}
{"Input":"Wars, hitherto the only argument ","Output":"Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect "}
{"Input":"Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King: ","Output":"Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return "}
{"Input":"Can turn, or holds it possible to turn, ","Output":"Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold, "}
{"Input":"So all ere day-spring, under conscious night, ","Output":"Secret they finished, and in order set, "}
{"Input":"Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure ","Output":"Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute, "}
{"Input":"Of colour glorious, and effect so rare? ","Output":"Here matter new to gaze the Devil met "}
{"Input":"The trembling leaves, while universal Pan, ","Output":"Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, "}
{"Input":"The mind is its own place, and in itself ","Output":"Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. "}
{"Input":"Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. ","Output":"For strength from truth divided, and from just, "}
{"Input":"Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned, ","Output":"And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared "}
{"Input":"God looking forth will trouble all his host, ","Output":"And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command "}
{"Input":"Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more, ","Output":"Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, "}
{"Input":"The remedy; perhaps more valid arms, ","Output":"Weapons more violent, when next we meet, "}
{"Input":"He added not, and from her turned; but Eve, ","Output":"Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing "}
{"Input":"Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind ","Output":"Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail: "}
{"Input":"Hung over her enamoured, and beheld ","Output":"Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep, "}
{"Input":"Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured, ","Output":"But more illustrious made; since he the head "}
{"Input":"With hundreds and with thousands trooping came ","Output":"Attended. All access was thronged; the gates "}
{"Input":" His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul ","Output":" For ever with corruption there to dwell; "}
{"Input":"They sat them down to weep; nor only tears ","Output":"Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within "}
{"Input":"Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence ","Output":"Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven, "}
{"Input":"With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds ","Output":"And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, "}
{"Input":"By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more ","Output":"In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring "}
{"Input":"Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; ","Output":"Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails. "}
{"Input":"The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know, ","Output":"Why ask ye, and superfluous begin "}
{"Input":"Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, ","Output":"Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose, "}
{"Input":"Briareos or Typhon, whom the den ","Output":"By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast "}
{"Input":"Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight, ","Output":"With lowliness majestick from her seat, "}
{"Input":"Warriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost, ","Output":"If such astonishment as this can seize "}
{"Input":"Or monument to ages; and theron ","Output":"Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers: "}
{"Input":"With trumpet's regal sound the great result: ","Output":"Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim "}
{"Input":"From the sun's axle; they with labour pushed ","Output":"Oblique the centrick globe:  Some say, the sun "}
{"Input":"By sin of disobedience; till that hour ","Output":"Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain. "}
{"Input":"Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned ","Output":"Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed "}
{"Input":"Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth; ","Output":"I never from thy side henceforth to stray, "}
{"Input":"Under this ignorance of good and evil, ","Output":"Of God or death, of law or penalty? "}
{"Input":"Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon. ","Output":"To me, who with eternal famine pine, "}
{"Input":"Nor number, nor example, with him wrought ","Output":"To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind, "}
{"Input":"Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured; ","Output":"That both in him and all things, as is meet, "}
{"Input":"Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown ","Output":"That mountain as his garden-mould high raised "}
{"Input":"Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk ","Output":"With gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said, "}
{"Input":"In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King, ","Output":"All on a sudden miserable pain "}
{"Input":"To reach, and feed at once both body and mind? ","Output":"So saying, her rash hand in evil hour "}
{"Input":"That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow, ","Output":"Nightly I visit:  nor sometimes forget "}
{"Input":"Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. ","Output":" "}
{"Input":"At first, that Angel should with Angel war, ","Output":"And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet "}
{"Input":"With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek ","Output":"Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall "}
{"Input":"Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,) ","Output":"The heavens and all the constellations rung, "}
{"Input":"The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed, ","Output":"A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands "}
{"Input":"To whom our general ancestor replied. ","Output":"Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve, "}
{"Input":"Together both with next to almighty arm ","Output":"Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed "}
{"Input":"For want of other prey, but that he knows ","Output":"His end with mine involved, and knows that I "}
{"Input":"By thee communicated, and our want: ","Output":"For good unknown sure is not had; or, had "}
{"Input":"A bevy of fair women, richly gay ","Output":"In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung "}
{"Input":"National interrupt their publick peace, ","Output":"Provoking God to raise them enemies; "}
{"Input":"And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, ","Output":"Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe "}
{"Input":"From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm, ","Output":"And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, "}
{"Input":"In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed ","Output":"At first, that Angel should with Angel war, "}
{"Input":"Adam, by dire example, to beware ","Output":"Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven "}
{"Input":"As with a smile more brightened, thus replied. ","Output":"What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth "}
{"Input":"And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven ","Output":"Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, "}
{"Input":"Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast, ","Output":"Adam, estranged in look and altered style, "}
{"Input":"Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on, ","Output":"Or sympathy, or some connatural force, "}
{"Input":"To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou ","Output":"Of all those myriads which we lead the chief; "}
{"Input":"Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge: ","Output":"But the hot Hell that always in him burns, "}
{"Input":"Or of revived Adonis, or renowned ","Output":"Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son; "}
{"Input":"Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. ","Output":"Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, "}
{"Input":"$THeir freedom: they themselves ordain'd their fall. ","Output":"The first sort by their own suggestion fell, "}
{"Input":"His countenance too severe to be beheld, ","Output":"And full of wrath bent on his enemies. "}
{"Input":"Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep, ","Output":"With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, "}
{"Input":"That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand, ","Output":"Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell "}
{"Input":"Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest, ","Output":"He brought thee into this delicious grove, "}
{"Input":"Your numerous offspring; if no better place, ","Output":"Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge "}
{"Input":"Perfect within, no outward aid require; ","Output":"And all temptation to transgress repel. "}
{"Input":"Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite ","Output":"To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found "}
{"Input":"Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains, ","Output":"Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned, "}
{"Input":"Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain, ","Output":"With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air; "}
{"Input":"From either eye, and wiped them with her hair; ","Output":"Two other precious drops that ready stood, "}
{"Input":"Deserve the precious bane. And here let those ","Output":"Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell "}
{"Input":"And stripes and arbitrary punishment ","Output":"Inflicted? and what peace can we return, "}
{"Input":"The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred. ","Output":"So threatened he; but Satan to no threats "}
{"Input":"Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? ","Output":"Yet, by experience taught, we know how good, "}
{"Input":"Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue ","Output":"Relate thee!  Greater now in thy return "}
{"Input":"From all his alimental recompence ","Output":"In humid exhalations, and at even "}
{"Input":"Created him endowed; with happiness, ","Output":"And immortality: that fondly lost, "}
{"Input":"Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue ","Output":"With wonder, and could love, so lively shines "}
{"Input":"Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know. ","Output":"So promised he; and Uriel to his charge "}
{"Input":"So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked, who ","Output":"Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree, "}
{"Input":"With stubborn patience as with triple steel. ","Output":"Another part, in squadrons and gross bands, "}
{"Input":"Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused. ","Output":"Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits, "}
{"Input":"Of rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus ","Output":"With fish replenished, and the air with fowl, "}
{"Input":"Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, ","Output":"Though to delude them sent, could not abstain; "}
{"Input":"His heart I know, how variable and vain, ","Output":"Self-left.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand "}
{"Input":"That structure in the dialect of men ","Output":"Interpreted,) which not long after, he "}
{"Input":"Of highest agents, deemed however wise. ","Output":"Queen of this universe! do not believe "}
{"Input":"His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed ","Output":"Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he, "}
{"Input":"His great command; take heed lest passion sway ","Output":"Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will "}
{"Input":"The sensible of pain. All things invite ","Output":"To peaceful counsels, and the settled state "}
{"Input":"Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; ","Output":"For thee I have ordained it; and thus far "}
{"Input":"Frequent and full. After short silence then, ","Output":"And summons read, the great consult began. "}
{"Input":"In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud ","Output":"Made visible, the Almighty Father shines, "}
{"Input":"  He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, ","Output":"But, glad that now his sea should find a shore, "}
{"Input":"One way the self-same hour? why in the east ","Output":"Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light "}
{"Input":"Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, ","Output":"Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve "}
{"Input":"Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure ","Output":"Amber, and colours of the showery arch. "}
{"Input":"To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: ","Output":"Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud, "}
{"Input":"Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap ","Output":"Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked "}
{"Input":"Fairest of stars, last in the train of night, ","Output":"If better thou belong not to the dawn, "}
{"Input":"For such thou art; from sin and blame entire: ","Output":"Not diffident of thee do I dissuade "}
{"Input":"Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites: ","Output":"Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, "}
{"Input":"The only two of mankind, but in them ","Output":"The whole included race, his purposed prey. "}
{"Input":"Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, ","Output":"That to corporeal substances could add "}
{"Input":"Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth, ","Output":"Their boasted parents;--Titan, Heaven's first-born, "}
{"Input":"Or multiply, but curses on my head? ","Output":"Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling "}
{"Input":"To weary him with my assiduous cries: ","Output":"But prayer against his absolute decree "}
{"Input":"Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl, ","Output":"And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, "}
{"Input":"Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew ","Output":"What we receive, would either no accept "}
{"Input":"Some safer resolution, which methinks ","Output":"I have in view, calling to mind with heed "}
