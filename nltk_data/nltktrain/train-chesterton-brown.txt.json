{"Input":"thin fingers.  His name, which came out in the course of talk,","Output":"was James Dalroy; he was the son of a bankrupt Irish landlord,"}
{"Input":"spun out of something much simpler.  I've sometimes thought it was","Output":"a wild version of one of those mutilation stories.  They used to crop"}

{"Input":"he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession,","Output":"and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up."}

{"Input":"By the light of it I saw a man running across the field towards the road;","Output":"running with his body bent and at a good mile-race trot."}
{"Input":"His tall, slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked","Output":"the reverse of feeble.  His hair was silver-grey, but he did not look old;"}

{"Input":"a man being killed.\"","Output":"     Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a spring had"}

{"Input":"     But the little priest was looking rather curiously at the corners","Output":"and edges of the wood alleged to be rotten, and there was a sort of trouble"}
{"Input":"out of the coach.  But this time he did not fall into a little meadow","Output":"just beneath; he fell a thousand feet below, to become a wreck of bones"}
{"Input":"rather vaguely.","Output":"     \"No, sir,\" said the man shortly; \"he stayed behind, and then"}

{"Input":"     \"But, father,\" said Frank very warmly, \"an Italian gentleman has","Output":"led the way.  You wouldn't have it said that the English hung back.\""}
{"Input":"And he hesitated.","Output":"     \"Well?\" inquired the other."}

{"Input":"confidentially to Cutler.","Output":"     Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after:"}
{"Input":"prosperous-looking man, with conventional moustache and whiskers,","Output":"but a lively eye, which darted over Kidd dubiously."}
{"Input":"     Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head.","Output":"Flambeau and Fanshaw, now reinforced by some of the gipsies,"}
{"Input":"     \"He has been here for half an hour at least,\" thought Father Brown.","Output":"In fact, he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner"}

{"Input":"to be said on both sides.  At present she has only one lodger,","Output":"the young man called Todhunter; but he has given more trouble"}
{"Input":"It was one of the great police mysteries about twenty years ago.","Output":"You remember, of course, that this place was forcibly annexed"}
{"Input":"the ugly lamp-posts became less few and far between and more ornamental,","Output":"though quite equally ugly.  Half a mile farther on Father Brown"}

{"Input":"In fact, he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner","Output":"was cleared away."}
{"Input":"and then, quite naturally, strolled out himself into the upper end","Output":"of the passage.  Father Brown and Parkinson were left alone,"}
{"Input":"     Sir Wilson Seymour, however moved, had his excellent brains","Output":"in full working-order.  \"Very distinctly as regards its outline,"}

{"Input":"     \"There's that girl in the canoe again,\" said Flambeau irrelevantly,","Output":"for good-looking young women would call him off any topic."}
{"Input":"     But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering,","Output":"and he said hastily:  \"But, Admiral, what's that hissing noise"}
{"Input":"     \"Yes\" she said, with a face like marble.  \"I saw him do it.\"","Output":"     \"He died,\" said Father Brown, \"for love of you?\""}
{"Input":"     \"Had she picked any?\" asked the priest, staring rather vacantly","Output":"at the veil of the branches above him."}

{"Input":"     A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above.","Output":"\"My God,\" he exclaimed in French, \"I know what this place is now!"}
{"Input":"to stuff herself into an omnibus.  It is a rich confusion of","Output":"social self-congratulation and bodily disarray.  His hat tumbled"}

{"Input":"as I do.  Anyhow, that's the story of the Arnholds, and he was","Output":"the last survivor of them.  Yes, and of all the men who played parts"}
{"Input":"\"that's the first idea to get fixed; the absence of Mr Glass.","Output":"He is so extremely absent.  I suppose,\" he added reflectively,"}

{"Input":"     \"Ah!\" she said, and looked at him with eyes like diamonds.","Output":"     \"And the trivial thing was this,\" said Brown.  \"There were"}

{"Input":"     One evening he had sent for the priest, who, according to his custom,","Output":"took a seat in silence at a table piled and littered with papers,"}
{"Input":"     \"A woman's!\" cried the soldier.  \"Great Scott, no!\"","Output":"     \"The last witness said it was,\" commented the counsel,"}
{"Input":"so decisively was rather comic than tragic.  Father Brown gathered,","Output":"from the course of the conversation, that Cray, the other gourmet,"}

{"Input":"     \"Well, you go over there,\" said his adviser, \"and be ready","Output":"to rescue her from the rescue.\""}
{"Input":"he said softly:","Output":"     \"If you've got ten minutes, I wish you'd follow that man with"}

{"Input":"about with me.  I'm so fond of salads.\"","Output":"     And to the amazement of the two men he took a pepper-pot out of"}
{"Input":"Asked if it was a man or a woman, he said it looked more like a beast--","Output":"with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner.  But the man was plainly shaken"}
{"Input":"to resume his trudge in the twilight, telling himself it was no affair","Output":"of his, but instinctively twisting and untwisting twenty theories"}
{"Input":"Both were now well opened, and he could almost fancy the left eye","Output":"grew larger as he gazed."}

{"Input":"That demand for ransom was really taken seriously by most of the police.","Output":"But for years he's been doing things as good as that, quite as good"}
{"Input":"Nothing could be more different than his cynical negligence from","Output":"the dapper dryness of the young American; but something in his pencil"}

{"Input":"I saw that he was dark and bearded, and that his eyes were marked with","Output":"dark spectacles.  He was dressed poorly but respectably in black,"}
{"Input":"who knew his friend, knew that his friend had suddenly understood.","Output":"Brown said nothing, but finished his plate of fish."}

{"Input":"     \"It can never be utterly stamped out,\" Muscari answered;","Output":"\"because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners."}

{"Input":"All the full-dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant.","Output":"He had realized suddenly that he could do without them."}
{"Input":"     The prize-fighter stood glaring for a few seconds, and then,","Output":"rather to the surprise of Flambeau and the others, strode out,"}

{"Input":"     The anger of the Italian policeman, which he expressed volubly","Output":"to Father Brown, was largely mixed with admiration.  \"It was like him"}

{"Input":"If it's white instead of black, and solid instead of liquid,","Output":"and so on all along the line--then there's something wrong, Monsieur,"}

{"Input":"     Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational,","Output":"but real sense of some monstrosity.  They had forgotten the figure"}
{"Input":"but you shall judge of the whole story.  Old Putnam and I were friends","Output":"in the same mess; but, owing to some accidents on the Afghan border,"}
{"Input":"until at last, when we had crested the sand-hills, Philip's patience","Output":"(which was by no means so conspicuous on most occasions) seemed to snap."}
{"Input":"     He was a stoutish, fair man, in his shirt-sleeves; his movements","Output":"were resolute, his mouth firm and his tones final; but his round,"}
