{"Input":"moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation","Output":"and enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,"}
{"Input":"which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man","Output":"of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her"}
{"Input":"The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite","Output":"any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell"}
{"Input":"or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were","Output":"going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,"}

{"Input":"an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her","Output":"very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,"}
{"Input":"It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house","Output":"in his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found"}
{"Input":"just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!","Output":"In the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?"}
{"Input":"There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment","Output":"of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience"}

{"Input":"who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished","Output":"behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report,"}
{"Input":"more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.","Output":"In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,"}
{"Input":"admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting","Output":"great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her."}

{"Input":"his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure","Output":"that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,"}
{"Input":"under which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not","Output":"imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,"}
{"Input":"But it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.","Output":"Can any thing be stronger?\""}
{"Input":"she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!","Output":"There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,"}
{"Input":"that at such a time there will be the means of marrying,","Output":"I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents"}
{"Input":"by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.","Output":"Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with"}

{"Input":"and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,","Output":"and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated"}
{"Input":"at Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.","Output":"The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience"}
{"Input":"such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence","Output":"in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits"}
{"Input":"Mary, too, was growing calmer.","Output":"The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible."}
{"Input":"who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest","Output":"in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her"}

{"Input":"now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation","Output":"of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,"}
{"Input":"an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.","Output":"Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was"}

{"Input":"a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter","Output":"which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing"}
{"Input":"he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,","Output":"and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her"}
{"Input":"At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose","Output":"than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be","Output":"the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,"}
{"Input":"I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me","Output":"excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know"}
{"Input":"of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have","Output":"done otherwise."}
{"Input":"she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,","Output":"\"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again"}

{"Input":"I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"","Output":"Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband."}
{"Input":"\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith's answer,","Output":"given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;"}
{"Input":"meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.","Output":"He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death,"}
{"Input":"and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself","Output":"much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,"}
{"Input":"had been followed by a little history of his private life,","Output":"which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies."}
{"Input":"of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family","Output":"and the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted"}
{"Input":"By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,","Output":"which you shot with one day round Winthrop.\""}
{"Input":"and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing","Output":"how to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own"}

{"Input":"She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness","Output":"of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's room,"}
{"Input":"and you wanted nothing beyond.\"","Output":"\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious"}
{"Input":"But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.","Output":"Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes"}

{"Input":"did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together","Output":"some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,"}
{"Input":"and he was gone directly.","Output":"Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive."}
{"Input":"She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there","Output":"to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,"}
{"Input":"and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.","Output":"Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,"}
{"Input":"which a few hours might comprehend.","Output":"\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry"}
{"Input":"was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning","Output":"to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it."}
{"Input":"and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--","Output":"\"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts"}
{"Input":"I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn","Output":"every blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils"}
{"Input":"The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:","Output":"Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself"}
{"Input":"confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine","Output":"how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her."}
{"Input":"and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,","Output":"and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements"}
{"Input":"that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,","Output":"and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them"}
{"Input":"and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,","Output":"was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning"}
{"Input":"and absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;","Output":"it was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded"}
{"Input":"had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing","Output":"the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,"}
{"Input":"may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville","Output":"at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,"}
{"Input":"Was he at all such as he appears now?\"","Output":"\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith's answer,"}
{"Input":"looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.","Output":"\"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her"}
{"Input":"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"","Output":"\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;"}
{"Input":"in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could","Output":"give his daughter at present but a small part of the share"}
{"Input":"You must not run away from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted","Output":"with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,"}
{"Input":"than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each","Output":"to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary"}
{"Input":"particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition","Output":"and rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,"}
{"Input":"and from strong features and want of health, looking much older","Output":"than Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,"}
{"Input":"than any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,","Output":"her look and manner declared, that go she would not."}
{"Input":"very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear","Output":"to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two"}
{"Input":"and which supply me with the means of doing a little good","Output":"to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood."}
{"Input":"her moments of imagining.","Output":"A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party"}
{"Input":"stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;","Output":"but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister"}
{"Input":"\"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess","Output":"to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;"}
{"Input":"Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.","Output":"Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back"}
{"Input":"\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall","Output":"we say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from"}

{"Input":"with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind,","Output":"I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\""}
{"Input":"and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed","Output":"she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing"}
{"Input":"\"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\"","Output":"and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do"}
{"Input":"\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned","Output":"the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint"}
{"Input":"as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.","Output":"Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,"}
{"Input":"with Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation","Output":"of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;"}
{"Input":"I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,","Output":"with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;"}
{"Input":"that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not","Output":"stir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only"}
{"Input":"\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;","Output":"and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness."}
{"Input":"some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.","Output":"She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings"}
{"Input":"very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character","Output":"might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,"}
{"Input":"I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me","Output":"with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,"}
{"Input":"\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\"","Output":"and the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies"}
{"Input":"of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.","Output":"Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,"}
{"Input":"but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.","Output":"We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level."}
{"Input":"\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy","Output":"to see Captain Benwick.\""}
{"Input":"coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,","Output":"took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,"}
{"Input":"proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself","Output":"and on Captain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house,"}
{"Input":"should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;","Output":"and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open"}
{"Input":"would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's","Output":"being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being"}
{"Input":"to recover her.","Output":"Chapter 10"}
{"Input":"Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.","Output":"Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!"}
{"Input":"on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as","Output":"an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,"}
{"Input":"but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room","Output":"to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,"}
{"Input":"I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"","Output":"After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--"}
{"Input":"to go with the others.","Output":"Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty."}
{"Input":"and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,","Output":"as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot"}
{"Input":"still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne","Output":"to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,"}
{"Input":"You know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.","Output":"Excellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,"}
{"Input":"our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;","Output":"for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject"}
{"Input":"sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was","Output":"very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share"}
{"Input":"With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself","Output":"and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,"}
{"Input":"\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded","Output":"you must have been obliged to give up the party.\""}
{"Input":"either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,","Output":"perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored"}
{"Input":"the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment","Output":"she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,"}
{"Input":"By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"","Output":"She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,","Output":"evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined"}
{"Input":"Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been","Output":"at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;"}
{"Input":"to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them","Output":"to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been"}
{"Input":"probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,","Output":"and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne."}
{"Input":"the advantage of such resident curate's being married.","Output":"\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,"}
{"Input":"\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!","Output":"that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,"}
{"Input":"a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat","Output":"that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,"}
{"Input":"proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,","Output":"there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement."}
{"Input":"in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed","Output":"able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,"}
{"Input":"\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove","Output":"to Mrs Croft."}
{"Input":"right to be done.","Output":"While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth"}
{"Input":"wishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself","Output":"for the folly which asked the question."}
{"Input":"and added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;","Output":"you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,"}
{"Input":"but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into","Output":"the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,"}
{"Input":"Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel","Output":"explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying"}
{"Input":"more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed","Output":"Isle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,"}
{"Input":"time will explain.\"","Output":"It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,"}
{"Input":"for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts","Output":"are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty."}
{"Input":"Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every","Output":"enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits"}
{"Input":"Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,","Output":"but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,"}
{"Input":"She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,","Output":"but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,"}
{"Input":"was quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief","Output":"to be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine."}
{"Input":"as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;","Output":"but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected"}
{"Input":"of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"","Output":"\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would"}
{"Input":"so Mrs Clay says, at least.\"","Output":"\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder"}
{"Input":"has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"","Output":"This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short"}
{"Input":"She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked","Output":"to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,"}
{"Input":"They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,","Output":"we may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we"}
{"Input":"in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years,","Output":"to be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain"}
{"Input":"and beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.","Output":"It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other"}
{"Input":"for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick","Output":"attending to her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along,"}
{"Input":"and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.","Output":"Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is"}
{"Input":"they were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!","Output":"It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything"}
{"Input":"no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"","Output":"\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose."}
{"Input":"there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,","Output":"I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\""}
{"Input":"walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,","Output":"he burst forth, as if wholly overcome--"}
{"Input":"I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and","Output":"pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can"}
{"Input":"Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless","Output":"of doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,"}
{"Input":"not given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!","Output":"But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\""}
{"Input":"and on Captain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house,","Output":"near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled."}
{"Input":"\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"","Output":"\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\""}

{"Input":"had a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see","Output":"how the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable"}
{"Input":"of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse","Output":"by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,"}

{"Input":"her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be","Output":"with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,"}
{"Input":"told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;","Output":"but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour"}
{"Input":"her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.","Output":"There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as"}
{"Input":"the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.","Output":"Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit"}
{"Input":"setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;","Output":"for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer"}
{"Input":"\"When did that happen?\"","Output":"\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;"}
{"Input":"that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.","Output":"Charles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what"}

{"Input":"the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him","Output":"peculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,"}
{"Input":"to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;","Output":"but always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she"}
{"Input":"Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture","Output":"of happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,"}
{"Input":"very audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!","Output":"You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\""}
{"Input":"Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,","Output":"with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends"}
{"Input":"The past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth","Output":"would move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,"}
{"Input":"to see Captain Benwick.\"","Output":"\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am."}

{"Input":"Where could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.","Output":"It had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;"}

{"Input":"Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object","Output":"of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented."}
{"Input":"she was anxious to be at home.","Output":"The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly"}

{"Input":"her mind was in confusion.","Output":"Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,"}
{"Input":"He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised","Output":"to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself."}
{"Input":"considered the walk as under their guidance.","Output":"Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where"}
{"Input":"an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation","Output":"when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft"}

{"Input":"To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope","Output":"to influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,"}
{"Input":"too much self-occupied to hear.","Output":"\"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,"}

{"Input":"she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had","Output":"no wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought"}
{"Input":"She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis","Output":"said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness"}

{"Input":"with affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;","Output":"so Mrs Clay says, at least.\""}
{"Input":"\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,\"","Output":"said Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity."}
{"Input":"Her happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;","Output":"but she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of"}

{"Input":"very well, if it were not for Mary's interference,\" was what","Output":"Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;"}
{"Input":"It was ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine","Output":"in Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home"}
{"Input":"it was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be","Output":"too much self-occupied to hear."}
{"Input":"I did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.","Output":"When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park"}
{"Input":"Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves","Output":"that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife"}
{"Input":"the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense","Output":"he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as"}
{"Input":"at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath","Output":"over London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient"}

{"Input":"the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's.  He had intended,","Output":"on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,"}
{"Input":"The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was","Output":"in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,"}
{"Input":"as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.","Output":"She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,"}
{"Input":"giving her daughters.","Output":"This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been"}
{"Input":"that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being","Output":"in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long."}
{"Input":"and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest","Output":"and his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's"}
{"Input":"She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,","Output":"and especially the history of her own family, must ever present"}

{"Input":"recovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.","Output":"That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say"}
{"Input":"than any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed","Output":"by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself"}
{"Input":"\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters","Output":"for one another.\"  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought"}
{"Input":"to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near.  As she joined him,","Output":"Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful"}
{"Input":"was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have","Output":"lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them."}
{"Input":"And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering","Output":"in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do;"}
{"Input":"a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;","Output":"and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from"}
{"Input":"the work of an instant!","Output":"The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost"}
{"Input":"on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never","Output":"alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently"}
{"Input":"He got up and moved away.","Output":"\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove"}
{"Input":"on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope his letter","Output":"does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\""}
{"Input":"And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,","Output":"is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match."}
{"Input":"She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.","Output":"She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\""}
{"Input":"also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.","Output":"She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,"}
{"Input":"of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction","Output":"was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being"}
{"Input":"We were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always","Output":"such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves."}
{"Input":"that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.","Output":"They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had"}
{"Input":"and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,","Output":"which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,"}
{"Input":"attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady","Output":"had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been"}
{"Input":"such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,","Output":"its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of"}

{"Input":"into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:","Output":"the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning."}
{"Input":"and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.","Output":"He was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together."}
{"Input":"the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious","Output":"of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves"}
{"Input":"long courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,","Output":"between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together"}
{"Input":"drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think","Output":"Lady Russell would like that?\""}
{"Input":"a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,","Output":"which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements"}
{"Input":"my father's acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed","Output":"to take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\""}
{"Input":"was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could","Output":"prevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through"}
{"Input":"Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?","Output":"It will be some trial to us both.\""}
{"Input":"burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character","Output":"of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,"}
{"Input":"intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw","Output":"a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme"}
{"Input":"only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort.","Output":"All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;"}
{"Input":"to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,","Output":"and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea."}

{"Input":"\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd,","Output":"whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's retrenching,"}
{"Input":"I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,","Output":"he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot' and he had"}

{"Input":"really so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,","Output":"as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever"}
{"Input":"\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,","Output":"\"it is the very man we passed.\""}
{"Input":"under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference","Output":"to any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture"}
{"Input":"Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything","Output":"should happen?\""}
{"Input":"Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once:","Output":"got away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story"}
{"Input":"and mother's rights, it would be prevented.","Output":"Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;"}
{"Input":"struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments","Output":"and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of"}
{"Input":"and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them","Output":"did decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who"}

{"Input":"not to judge him beforehand.\"","Output":"\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\""}
{"Input":"and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,","Output":"I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are"}
{"Input":"but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him","Output":"no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow."}
{"Input":"and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"","Output":"At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house"}
{"Input":"who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come","Output":"at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,"}
{"Input":"representing a borough in three successive parliaments,","Output":"exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year"}
{"Input":"much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,","Output":"much more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,"}
{"Input":"settled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make","Output":"long courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,"}
{"Input":"year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,","Output":"who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me."}
{"Input":"younger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\"","Output":"They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,"}
{"Input":"inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,","Output":"that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,"}
{"Input":"I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed","Output":"deep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect."}
{"Input":"she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been","Output":"neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any"}
{"Input":"Troubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually","Output":"withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all"}

{"Input":"that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when","Output":"they last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return"}
{"Input":"to be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain","Output":"by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance."}
{"Input":"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;","Output":"vanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome"}
{"Input":"large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:","Output":"Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably."}
{"Input":"There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women","Output":"to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear"}

{"Input":"and daring not even to try to observe their effect.","Output":"It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;"}
{"Input":"when she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast","Output":"the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence"}
{"Input":"\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,","Output":"\"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\""}
{"Input":"but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;","Output":"not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted"}
{"Input":"called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.","Output":"You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,"}
{"Input":"unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything","Output":"to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,"}
{"Input":"he observed sarcastically--","Output":"\"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would"}
{"Input":"They did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion","Output":"she perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance,"}
{"Input":"and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her","Output":"and Henrietta directly."}
{"Input":"come to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;","Output":"and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed"}
{"Input":"Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure","Output":"of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,"}
{"Input":"which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement","Output":"at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware"}
{"Input":"as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted","Output":"to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered"}
{"Input":"\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"","Output":"\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,"}
{"Input":"any question you may wish to put.\"","Output":"\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her."}
{"Input":"on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel","Output":"at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons"}
{"Input":"you will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place","Output":"of a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying"}
{"Input":"Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father","Output":"had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent."}

{"Input":"But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,","Output":"I think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,"}
{"Input":"must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her","Output":"at the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,"}

{"Input":"full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by","Output":"Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--"}
{"Input":"Anne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain","Output":"that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,"}
{"Input":"the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly","Output":"down to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement"}
{"Input":"of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;","Output":"she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;"}
{"Input":"perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored","Output":"to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;"}

{"Input":"lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,","Output":"and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself."}
{"Input":"Excellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,","Output":"so much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,"}
{"Input":"suspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!","Output":"It was ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine"}

{"Input":"as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever","Output":"separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely"}
{"Input":"I must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?","Output":"Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,"}
{"Input":"could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,","Output":"spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling."}

{"Input":"the highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother's self","Output":"in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you"}
{"Input":"who lived at Monkford:  Mrs Croft's brother?\"","Output":"But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not"}
{"Input":"and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have","Output":"some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through"}
{"Input":"the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room","Output":"to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,"}
{"Input":"After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,","Output":"the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly"}
{"Input":"I shall be at your service in half a minute.\"","Output":"Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter"}
{"Input":"a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"","Output":"\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband's answer, \"and I should be"}
{"Input":"she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!","Output":"The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,","Output":"he observed sarcastically--"}
{"Input":"\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,","Output":"\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,"}
{"Input":"than in its national importance.","Output":"        Finis"}
{"Input":"before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.","Output":"But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;"}
{"Input":"Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance","Output":"to damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,"}
{"Input":"She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her","Output":"of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims"}
{"Input":"and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.","Output":"The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation"}
{"Input":"Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne","Output":"could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem"}
{"Input":"I wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,","Output":"you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined"}
{"Input":"without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,","Output":"was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,"}
{"Input":"Who is your party?\"","Output":"Anne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was"}
{"Input":"\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;","Output":"\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense"}
{"Input":"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,","Output":"deprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,"}
{"Input":"only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;","Output":"and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,"}
{"Input":"as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.","Output":"Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;"}
{"Input":"and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;","Output":"and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt"}
{"Input":"for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.","Output":"That was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on"}
{"Input":"or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much","Output":"as the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was"}
{"Input":"the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.","Output":"She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,"}
{"Input":"\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,","Output":"and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence."}
{"Input":"When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.","Output":"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;"}
{"Input":"She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove","Output":"to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street."}
{"Input":"to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.","Output":"A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by"}
{"Input":"said Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing","Output":"that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,"}
{"Input":"since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,","Output":"that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman"}
{"Input":"In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,","Output":"surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous"}
{"Input":"that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,","Output":"she was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison"}
{"Input":"to take its chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude","Output":"or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different"}
{"Input":"It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came","Output":"through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,"}
{"Input":"quite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her","Output":"had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure"}
{"Input":"sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.","Output":"Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles"}
{"Input":"and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure","Output":"as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be"}
{"Input":"evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they","Output":"gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof"}
{"Input":"who had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been","Output":"to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said"}
{"Input":"and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.","Output":"The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,"}
{"Input":"and the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\"","Output":"\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne."}
{"Input":"a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;","Output":"here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,"}
{"Input":"that is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one","Output":"know one's species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,"}
{"Input":"for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined","Output":"such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent"}
{"Input":"\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!","Output":"Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,"}
{"Input":"Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,","Output":"that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,"}
{"Input":"she had no reason to believe him married.","Output":"How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,"}
{"Input":"True, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised","Output":"at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did."}
{"Input":"against the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in","Output":"the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries"}
{"Input":"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,","Output":"in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial","Output":"on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay"}
{"Input":"The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,","Output":"Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes"}
{"Input":"The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple","Output":"and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her."}
{"Input":"\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.","Output":"\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's"}
{"Input":"except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.","Output":"Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme"}
{"Input":"youth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference","Output":"of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother's love,"}
{"Input":"to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up","Output":"the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window."}
{"Input":"what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement","Output":"the house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,"}
{"Input":"alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;","Output":"he thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,"}
{"Input":"around them.  She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,","Output":"to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found"}
{"Input":"my father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;","Output":"but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to"}
{"Input":"I always forgot.\"","Output":"\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,"}
{"Input":"attention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.","Output":"There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant"}
{"Input":"and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,","Output":"felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards"}
{"Input":"for the folly which asked the question.","Output":"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom"}
{"Input":"to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above","Output":"four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter"}
{"Input":"There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"","Output":"(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget"}
{"Input":"as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had","Output":"little curiosity beyond."}
{"Input":"and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,","Output":"and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne"}
{"Input":"had been their lasting effect.","Output":"More than seven years were gone since this little history"}
{"Input":"Anne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was","Output":"leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,"}
{"Input":"but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected","Output":"by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment"}
{"Input":"in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!","Output":"My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt"}
{"Input":"As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,","Output":"or more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were"}
{"Input":"benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure","Output":"or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give"}
{"Input":"wherewith to pity her.","Output":"Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds"}
{"Input":"It is Mr Elliot himself.\"","Output":"\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you."}
{"Input":"and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was","Output":"his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads"}
{"Input":"the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.","Output":"She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,"}
{"Input":"in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins","Output":"within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,"}
{"Input":"Is he coming, Louisa?\"","Output":"One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,"}
{"Input":"and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.","Output":"He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,"}
{"Input":"by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?","Output":"No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have"}
{"Input":"however undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,","Output":"but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept"}
{"Input":"an engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing","Output":"that at such a time there will be the means of marrying,"}
{"Input":"there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs","Output":"changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over"}
{"Input":"with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement","Output":"of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable."}
{"Input":"they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,","Output":"with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present"}
{"Input":"hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.","Output":"He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation."}
{"Input":"They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were","Output":"perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing."}
{"Input":"He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face","Output":"would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,"}
{"Input":"you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,","Output":"or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke"}
{"Input":"afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed","Output":"as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent"}
{"Input":"patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices","Output":"that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish"}
{"Input":"all been so concerned for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been","Output":"happening to.  Her Christian name:  I always forget her Christian name.\""}
{"Input":"she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.","Output":"She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"to think seriously till it is almost too late.\"","Output":"Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been"}
{"Input":"or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;","Output":"but I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you."}
{"Input":"and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,","Output":"proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession"}
{"Input":"in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her","Output":"in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted"}
{"Input":"She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,","Output":"or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage"}
{"Input":"to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,","Output":"for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had"}
{"Input":"to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that","Output":"he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her."}
{"Input":"on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would","Output":"have been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,"}
{"Input":"that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,","Output":"and returning through the well-known apartments."}
{"Input":"In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,","Output":"so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,"}
{"Input":"always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard","Output":"with respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed"}
{"Input":"he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,","Output":"nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it"}
{"Input":"their deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,","Output":"to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter"}
{"Input":"There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,","Output":"and this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,"}
{"Input":"they created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,","Output":"accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired"}
{"Input":"to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.","Output":"This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,"}
{"Input":"in books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.","Output":"Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has"}
{"Input":"to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements","Output":"which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured"}
{"Input":"\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.","Output":"Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away"}
{"Input":"placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it,","Output":"that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution"}
{"Input":"a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,","Output":"to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand"}
{"Input":"equally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt","Output":"that he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,"}
{"Input":"but any indisposition sunk her completely.  She had no resources","Output":"for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot"}
{"Input":"he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.","Output":"She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme."}
{"Input":"were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked","Output":"before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride"}
{"Input":"When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;","Output":"though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;"}
{"Input":"I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted","Output":"with him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way"}
{"Input":"he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,","Output":"as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,"}
{"Input":"of life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--","Output":"contractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer"}
{"Input":"and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,","Output":"he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,"}
{"Input":"I think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,","Output":"wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,"}
{"Input":"forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,","Output":"but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed"}
{"Input":"in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;","Output":"and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance"}
{"Input":"waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,","Output":"she said she would go home."}
{"Input":"a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;","Output":"knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished"}
{"Input":"at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid","Output":"Mr Elliot was almost a first object."}
{"Input":"or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.","Output":"There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle"}
{"Input":"a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;","Output":"and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,"}
{"Input":"the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying","Output":"your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights,"}
{"Input":"gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof","Output":"of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being"}
{"Input":"his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,","Output":"with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage"}
{"Input":"to excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,","Output":"of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work."}
{"Input":"in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;","Output":"and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you"}
{"Input":"Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,","Output":"no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she","Output":"and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;"}
{"Input":"the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.","Output":"There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women"}
{"Input":"that he would let it at all.","Output":"How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had"}
{"Input":"nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch:","Output":"\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be"}
{"Input":"\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville","Output":"anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed, my dear,"}
{"Input":"in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"","Output":"\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,"}
{"Input":"They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered","Output":"their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly"}
{"Input":"\"But it rains.\"","Output":"\"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.\""}
{"Input":"has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient","Output":"to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections"}
{"Input":"fail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,","Output":"have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was"}
{"Input":"\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing","Output":"you were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\""}
{"Input":"without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,","Output":"or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use."}
{"Input":"in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;","Output":"does not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own"}
{"Input":"\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft","Output":"will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall."}
{"Input":"of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began","Output":"to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,"}
{"Input":"\"And I do assure you, ma'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed","Output":"the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates."}
{"Input":"by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,","Output":"it will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head."}
{"Input":"walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.","Output":"She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing"}
{"Input":"of former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad","Output":"that I can produce it.\""}
{"Input":"dreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort","Output":"to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted"}
{"Input":"and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home","Output":"the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage"}
{"Input":"Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself","Output":"of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life."}
{"Input":"of the family, one who having brought up all the children,","Output":"and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,"}
{"Input":"to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,","Output":"so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth"}

{"Input":"nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer","Output":"in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her"}
{"Input":"can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor","Output":"Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine"}
{"Input":"To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,","Output":"Anne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain"}
{"Input":"had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten","Output":"all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation."}
{"Input":"burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if","Output":"all his own strength were gone."}
{"Input":"dared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance","Output":"was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention"}
{"Input":"and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter","Output":"in all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry"}
{"Input":"everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.","Output":"Chapter 22"}
{"Input":"\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,","Output":"and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this"}
{"Input":"and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's","Output":"not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect"}
{"Input":"by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables","Output":"placed in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits"}
{"Input":"of Miss Elliot's charms.\"","Output":"\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,"}
{"Input":"which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.","Output":"Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,"}
{"Input":"he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;","Output":"Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,"}
{"Input":"his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid","Output":"and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for"}
{"Input":"Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself","Output":"on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others"}
{"Input":"attending to her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along,","Output":"to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed"}
{"Input":"incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,","Output":"by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility."}
{"Input":"injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there","Output":"till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,"}
{"Input":"separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely","Output":"by anybody else.\""}
{"Input":"Captain Harville has no thought but of going.\"","Output":"\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry."}
{"Input":"which so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;","Output":"gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling"}
{"Input":"you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,","Output":"I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\""}
{"Input":"she had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,","Output":"a something between delight and misery."}
{"Input":"and Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say","Output":"it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy."}
{"Input":"indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.","Output":"You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything"}
{"Input":"would not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!","Output":"It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much"}

{"Input":"when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget","Output":"what you did.\""}
{"Input":"and praise him!\"","Output":"\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith's reply, \"there was nothing else to be done."}

{"Input":"I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.","Output":"A'n't I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all."}
{"Input":"These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating","Output":"her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed"}

{"Input":"as any set of people one should meet with.  Therefore, Sir Walter,","Output":"what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of"}
{"Input":"much extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;","Output":"but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly"}

{"Input":"allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of","Output":"getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.","Output":"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back"}
{"Input":"since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character","Output":"to any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,"}
{"Input":"She could not keep her appointment punctually, however;","Output":"the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain"}
{"Input":"Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after","Output":"Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been"}
{"Input":"a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,","Output":"which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind wishes,"}
{"Input":"praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,","Output":"and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now"}
{"Input":"and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again","Output":"confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;"}
{"Input":"\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will","Output":"be turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be"}
{"Input":"expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away","Output":"with unalterable coldness."}
{"Input":"and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick","Output":"is expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell would like that?\"","Output":"Lady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she,"}
{"Input":"he had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible","Output":"for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot"}
{"Input":"and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements","Output":"in order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that"}
{"Input":"\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;","Output":"Captain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant"}
{"Input":"in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.","Output":"I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery"}
{"Input":"the additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,","Output":"who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,"}
{"Input":"He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since","Output":"whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation"}
{"Input":"for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"","Output":"\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!"}
{"Input":"\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,","Output":"and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having"}
{"Input":"with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.","Output":"You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish"}
{"Input":"Chapter 8","Output":"From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly"}
{"Input":"a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs","Output":"a note of explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence,"}
{"Input":"were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,","Output":"the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,"}
{"Input":"in observing--","Output":"\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;"}

{"Input":"her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain","Output":"Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them."}
{"Input":"Chapter 14","Output":"Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after"}
{"Input":"\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,","Output":"though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe."}
{"Input":"and Anne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine","Output":"a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been"}
{"Input":"and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath","Output":"till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time"}

{"Input":"to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed","Output":"rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse"}
{"Input":"Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had","Output":"moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation"}
{"Input":"which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,","Output":"as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old"}
{"Input":"Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,","Output":"though there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;"}
{"Input":"at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons","Output":"of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,"}
{"Input":"Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough","Output":"for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined"}
{"Input":"the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,","Output":"in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years,"}
{"Input":"that she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;","Output":"they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must"}
{"Input":"I am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,","Output":"and want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\""}
{"Input":"what no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have","Output":"been extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea."}
{"Input":"you called yesterday?\"","Output":"\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed"}
{"Input":"she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency","Output":"came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused;"}

{"Input":"doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,","Output":"by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?"}
{"Input":"Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with","Output":"one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),"}
{"Input":"of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,","Output":"or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister."}
{"Input":"Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,","Output":"and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing."}
{"Input":"\"Poor Frederick!\" said he at last.  \"Now he must begin all over again","Output":"with somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,"}
{"Input":"and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,","Output":"was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,"}
{"Input":"of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple","Output":"must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires"}
{"Input":"Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,","Output":"uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person."}
{"Input":"who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself","Output":"in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could"}
{"Input":"to design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word","Output":"\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned"}
{"Input":"and she continued--","Output":"\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,"}
{"Input":"and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place","Output":"but for her birth."}
{"Input":"Anne could combat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet","Output":"have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will,"}
{"Input":"sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy","Output":"were more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father"}
{"Input":"\"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"","Output":"It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had"}
{"Input":"and invitations, were designing a match between the heir","Output":"and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match"}
{"Input":"seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence","Output":"of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before."}
{"Input":"for my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people","Output":"to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry"}
{"Input":"for her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.","Output":"Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! so do I.\"","Output":"\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot."}
{"Input":"She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would","Output":"make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad"}
{"Input":"startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined","Output":"to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been"}
{"Input":"to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid:","Output":"I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest","Output":"of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple"}
{"Input":"They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all","Output":"the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain"}
{"Input":"\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with","Output":"what I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive"}
{"Input":"and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,","Output":"talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners"}
{"Input":"nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better","Output":"arranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed"}
{"Input":"this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit","Output":"an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to"}
{"Input":"nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:","Output":"an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in"}
{"Input":"which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:","Output":"Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate"}
{"Input":"\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,","Output":"we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance"}
{"Input":"appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,","Output":"his sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being"}
{"Input":"for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed","Output":"so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery"}
{"Input":"Anne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,","Output":"though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view"}
{"Input":"She checked herself just in time.","Output":"\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\""}
{"Input":"he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case","Output":"which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,"}
{"Input":"would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse","Output":"was open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\""}
{"Input":"I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"","Output":"\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,"}

{"Input":"was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.","Output":"Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,"}
{"Input":"Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,","Output":"was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could"}
{"Input":"They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship","Output":"of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;"}
{"Input":"Does he know that I am in Bath?\"","Output":"\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's reflection"}
{"Input":"His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,","Output":"and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other"}
{"Input":"Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live","Output":"entirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely,"}
{"Input":"of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony","Output":"of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines"}
{"Input":"without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,","Output":"to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:"}
{"Input":"\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of","Output":"the second Sir Walter.\""}
{"Input":"They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,","Output":"and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly"}
{"Input":"and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in","Output":"the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,"}
{"Input":"to meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart","Output":"than I have.  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever."}
{"Input":"and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.","Output":"Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,"}
{"Input":"as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was","Output":"his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival"}
{"Input":"Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,","Output":"and the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,"}

{"Input":"Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,","Output":"began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting"}
{"Input":"She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,","Output":"and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise"}
{"Input":"added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.","Output":"She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive"}
{"Input":"where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough","Output":"for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the"}
{"Input":"and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these","Output":"circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme."}
{"Input":"She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,","Output":"and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings"}
{"Input":"at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.","Output":"No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect"}

{"Input":"and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.","Output":"\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them."}

{"Input":"and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter","Output":"of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,"}
{"Input":"that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,","Output":"Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a secret,)--"}
{"Input":"\"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,","Output":"\"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate"}
{"Input":"in Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.","Output":"Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be"}
{"Input":"\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.","Output":"He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--"}
{"Input":"not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation","Output":"to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe"}
{"Input":"A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,","Output":"as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,"}
{"Input":"among the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised","Output":"that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,"}
{"Input":"How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,","Output":"would he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think"}
{"Input":"felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,","Output":"for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection"}
{"Input":"very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate","Output":"its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become"}

{"Input":"sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.","Output":"He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,"}
{"Input":"to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions","Output":"occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by"}
{"Input":"to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.","Output":"Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this"}
{"Input":"looked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;","Output":"and she remembered another person's look also."}
{"Input":"to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:","Output":"he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary"}
{"Input":"surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous","Output":"than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get"}
{"Input":"In all probability he was already the richer of the two,","Output":"and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title."}

{"Input":"the dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  She was now lying on the faded sofa","Output":"of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which"}
{"Input":"it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.","Output":"She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself."}
{"Input":"having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,","Output":"Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth."}
{"Input":"\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.","Output":"Have a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome."}
{"Input":"with great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening","Output":"with an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything"}
{"Input":"feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything","Output":"that would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!"}
{"Input":"Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,","Output":"and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to."}
{"Input":"or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days","Output":"of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after"}
{"Input":"he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"","Output":"But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,"}
{"Input":"\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me","Output":"in every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses"}
{"Input":"A sick child is always the mother's property:  her own feelings","Output":"generally make it so.\""}
{"Input":"\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.","Output":"One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,"}
{"Input":"but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.","Output":"\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent,"}
{"Input":"it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach","Output":"containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which"}

{"Input":"He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have","Output":"forgot all about Lyme.\""}
{"Input":"could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,","Output":"and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it"}
{"Input":"Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder","Output":"for a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,","Output":"listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--","Output":"of her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly"}
{"Input":"with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety","Output":"which they afterwards felt on his account."}
{"Input":"little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"","Output":"Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder"}
{"Input":"between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are","Output":"the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,"}
{"Input":"She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,","Output":"and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law."}
{"Input":"but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility","Output":"between the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was"}

{"Input":"the trouble of replying.\"","Output":"Sir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter has resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that","Output":"he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man"}
{"Input":"deep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.","Output":"It is Mr Elliot himself.\""}
{"Input":"which may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,","Output":"now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,"}
{"Input":"but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,","Output":"that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat"}
{"Input":"and no surname of dignity.","Output":"Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course"}
{"Input":"than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?","Output":"Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society"}
{"Input":"To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\"","Output":"Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,"}
{"Input":"was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.","Output":"There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,","Output":"but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,"}
{"Input":"to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;","Output":"did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:"}

{"Input":"the evening parties of the place.\"","Output":"\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me."}
{"Input":"Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.","Output":"How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval"}
{"Input":"he proceeded thus--","Output":"\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,"}
{"Input":"which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues","Output":"than in its national importance."}
{"Input":"Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;","Output":"and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character"}
{"Input":"that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,","Output":"to give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\""}
{"Input":"Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,","Output":"but never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath."}
{"Input":"but she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of","Output":"the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took"}

{"Input":"of finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect","Output":"that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,"}
{"Input":"She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;","Output":"go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,"}
{"Input":"It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices","Output":"with Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation"}
{"Input":"to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,","Output":"and tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,"}
{"Input":"thinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot","Output":"outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay."}
{"Input":"of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,","Output":"began with--"}
{"Input":"Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness","Output":"of character, which must have placed her high with any people"}
{"Input":"\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you","Output":"had a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see"}
{"Input":"But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.","Output":"I was willing to hope that you must fare better.\""}
{"Input":"and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful","Output":"in all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,"}
{"Input":"joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,","Output":"feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything"}
{"Input":"every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors,","Output":"may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\""}
{"Input":"shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;","Output":"and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,"}
{"Input":"After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but","Output":"express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably"}
{"Input":"to be communicated, and everything being to be done together,","Output":"however undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,"}
{"Input":"which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,","Output":"and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board"}
{"Input":"do you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much","Output":"waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of,"}

{"Input":"accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"","Output":"Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise."}
{"Input":"From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper","Output":"of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--"}

{"Input":"at the Great House?\"","Output":"\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,"}
{"Input":"and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places","Output":"in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;"}
{"Input":"within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,","Output":"and there must be intercourse between the two families."}
{"Input":"We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,","Output":"whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention"}
{"Input":"with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\"","Output":"\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid"}
{"Input":"she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both","Output":"was beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil"}
{"Input":"acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties","Output":"of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man"}
{"Input":"which they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\"","Output":"(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it."}
{"Input":"for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and","Output":"acquaintance were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face"}
{"Input":"and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;","Output":"but any indisposition sunk her completely.  She had no resources"}
{"Input":"of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,","Output":"she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable."}
{"Input":"Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it","Output":"advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,"}
{"Input":"and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,","Output":"he was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves"}
{"Input":"to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with","Output":"excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered"}
{"Input":"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;","Output":"and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,"}
{"Input":"For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.","Output":"While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,"}
{"Input":"that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be","Output":"respected and loved."}
{"Input":"and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,","Output":"sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery"}
{"Input":"He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,","Output":"\"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent."}
{"Input":"so hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,","Output":"he had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter"}
{"Input":"Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in","Output":"the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;"}
{"Input":"and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware","Output":"that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:"}
{"Input":"of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;","Output":"all the rest had been mere applications for money."}
{"Input":"very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,","Output":"little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\""}
{"Input":"in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted","Output":"in this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was"}
{"Input":"but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint","Output":"of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family"}
{"Input":"\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.","Output":"Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account"}
{"Input":"\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!","Output":"Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,"}
{"Input":"It will be some trial to us both.\"","Output":"Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,"}
{"Input":"was beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil","Output":"of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth"}

{"Input":"and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it","Output":"which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances"}
{"Input":"as it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.","Output":"We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who"}
{"Input":"I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.","Output":"A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think"}
{"Input":"Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.","Output":"\"By all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come."}
{"Input":"a general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked","Output":"saw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety"}
{"Input":"and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,","Output":"with respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured"}
{"Input":"not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,","Output":"moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman."}
{"Input":"she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta","Output":"had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten"}
{"Input":"was all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather","Output":"had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,"}
{"Input":"nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,","Output":"should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;"}
{"Input":"\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.","Output":"You misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of"}
{"Input":"he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),","Output":"\"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother."}
{"Input":"listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought","Output":"his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself."}
{"Input":"It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she","Output":"dared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance"}
{"Input":"and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped","Output":"better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,"}
{"Input":"the last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect","Output":"to have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than"}
{"Input":"and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions","Output":"than any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed"}
{"Input":"ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won","Output":"by her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,"}
{"Input":"and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,","Output":"to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week."}
{"Input":"and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him","Output":"of one personal grace!"}
{"Input":"and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings","Output":"this picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart"}
{"Input":"like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out","Output":"from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him."}
{"Input":"\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;","Output":"and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think"}
{"Input":"when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment","Output":"brought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation"}

{"Input":"The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,","Output":"Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.  The party drove off in very good spirits;"}
{"Input":"Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.","Output":"We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,"}
{"Input":"Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and","Output":"directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given"}
{"Input":"have that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"","Output":"Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;"}
{"Input":"\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,","Output":"\"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes"}
{"Input":"sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,","Output":"wherewith to pity her."}
{"Input":"the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part","Output":"of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of"}
{"Input":"Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's","Output":"following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had"}
{"Input":"to another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,","Output":"I was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,"}
{"Input":"her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,","Output":"made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it"}
{"Input":"\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.","Output":"I ought to have waited for official information,  But now, my dear"}
{"Input":"but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--","Output":"\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this"}
{"Input":"with my compliments.  He will be glad to hear it.\"","Output":"Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:"}
{"Input":"There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.","Output":"I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,"}
{"Input":"\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?","Output":"What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?\""}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.","Output":"\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man."}
{"Input":"will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;","Output":"I never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,"}
{"Input":"promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.","Output":"I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word"}
{"Input":"Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation","Output":"in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it."}
{"Input":"\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"","Output":"\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before."}
{"Input":"was indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such","Output":"a devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\""}
{"Input":"He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast","Output":"for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;"}
{"Input":"of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,","Output":"like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions"}
{"Input":"but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed","Output":"on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good"}
{"Input":"that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,","Output":"before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter"}
{"Input":"know one's species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,","Output":"to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly."}
{"Input":"became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained","Output":"the highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not"}
{"Input":"come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.","Output":"The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be"}
{"Input":"an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison","Output":"between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity,"}
{"Input":"that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,","Output":"from his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring"}
{"Input":"and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first","Output":"five minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was."}
{"Input":"she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing","Output":"our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;"}
{"Input":"in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral","Output":"and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves"}
{"Input":"as the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,","Output":"he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,"}
{"Input":"Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.","Output":"A sick child is always the mother's property:  her own feelings"}
{"Input":"I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents","Output":"should prevent as far as they can.\""}
{"Input":"The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.","Output":"\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name"}
{"Input":"\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.","Output":"But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here"}
{"Input":"with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,","Output":"to be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\""}
{"Input":"in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne's shudderings","Output":"were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open"}
{"Input":"when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed","Output":"the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope"}
{"Input":"as herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting","Output":"a great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had"}
{"Input":"and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back","Output":"with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,"}
{"Input":"I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"","Output":"\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,"}
{"Input":"where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;","Output":"for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,"}

{"Input":"have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,","Output":"than if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,"}
{"Input":"he observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him.\"","Output":"\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad"}
{"Input":"and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.","Output":"Here Anne had often been staying.  She knew the ways of Uppercross"}
{"Input":"it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than","Output":"either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer,"}
{"Input":"announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,","Output":"and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort"}
{"Input":"or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going","Output":"down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick"}
{"Input":"She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath","Output":"the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part"}
{"Input":"outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,","Output":"man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\""}
{"Input":"Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion","Output":"she certainly had not."}
{"Input":"\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think","Output":"I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and"}
{"Input":"There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes","Output":"were enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,"}
{"Input":"was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.","Output":"The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,"}
{"Input":"in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted","Output":"to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of"}
{"Input":"to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on","Output":"without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,"}
{"Input":"mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,","Output":"longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion"}
{"Input":"But Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away","Output":"from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest"}
{"Input":"In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,","Output":"at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,"}
{"Input":"all about it; and then `Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms!","Output":"Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were"}
{"Input":"the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,","Output":"the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend"}
{"Input":"their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,","Output":"Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction."}
{"Input":"placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her","Output":"for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,"}
{"Input":"it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed","Output":"in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment;"}
{"Input":"and not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.","Output":"I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\""}
{"Input":"Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest","Output":"daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice"}
{"Input":"The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,","Output":"and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard"}
{"Input":"that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be","Output":"recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all"}
{"Input":"from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple","Output":"for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening"}
{"Input":"a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit","Output":"to meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,"}
{"Input":"as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise","Output":"any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,"}
{"Input":"you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged","Output":"to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,"}
{"Input":"it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or","Output":"waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,"}
{"Input":"and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross","Output":"for the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity"}
{"Input":"could have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other","Output":"painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,"}
{"Input":"might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,","Output":"rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,"}
{"Input":"to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven","Output":"for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree."}
{"Input":"of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went","Output":"to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness"}
{"Input":"She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance","Output":"of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,"}
{"Input":"Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares","Output":"to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,"}
{"Input":"It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,","Output":"as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other"}
{"Input":"a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she","Output":"ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive"}
{"Input":"of the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,","Output":"appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,"}
{"Input":"I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.","Output":"You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation.  If in that light"}
{"Input":"during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal","Output":"of enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,"}
{"Input":"was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.","Output":"She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated."}
{"Input":"any indulgence of taste or pride.","Output":"Chapter 2"}
{"Input":"of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.","Output":"The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,"}
{"Input":"before the concert closed.","Output":"Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention","Output":"of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully"}
{"Input":"Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without","Output":"being much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot."}
{"Input":"and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.","Output":"On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,"}
{"Input":"of the party in general.","Output":"While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,"}
{"Input":"three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,","Output":"for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview"}
{"Input":"\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,","Output":"I dare say,\" had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural;"}
{"Input":"to come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,","Output":"but most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation"}
{"Input":"of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some","Output":"comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility"}
{"Input":"in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,","Output":"was a very sore aggravation."}
{"Input":"attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,","Output":"for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust"}
{"Input":"and thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed","Output":"before our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,"}
{"Input":"\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know","Output":"so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\""}
{"Input":"it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as","Output":"I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased"}
{"Input":"to be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking","Output":"as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,"}
{"Input":"better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,","Output":"and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;"}
{"Input":"which were least excusable.","Output":"She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath"}
{"Input":"of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;","Output":"but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,"}
{"Input":"were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,","Output":"neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be"}
{"Input":"I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\"","Output":"Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance"}
{"Input":"by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations","Output":"which her friend meant to create."}
{"Input":"perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once","Output":"charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;"}
{"Input":"Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,","Output":"you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there"}
{"Input":"as a very resolute character.","Output":"They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills"}
{"Input":"looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.","Output":"Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;"}
{"Input":"or when hope is gone.\"","Output":"She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart"}
{"Input":"to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness","Output":"of her enjoyment."}
{"Input":"shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,","Output":"I am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off."}
{"Input":"which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.","Output":"She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove"}
{"Input":"but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight","Output":"of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places,"}
{"Input":"It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;","Output":"the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,"}
{"Input":"she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing","Output":"by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,"}
{"Input":"and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,","Output":"having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall"}
{"Input":"\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having","Output":"this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you"}
{"Input":"in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of","Output":"Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him,"}
{"Input":"much more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,","Output":"without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;"}
{"Input":"Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,","Output":"and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had"}
{"Input":"that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"","Output":"Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father"}
{"Input":"though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies","Output":"on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,"}
{"Input":"the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.","Output":"\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome."}
{"Input":"which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,","Output":"and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing."}
{"Input":"had spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.","Output":"She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,"}
{"Input":"could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had","Output":"a moment's astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost"}
{"Input":"a hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,","Output":"and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see"}
{"Input":"and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,","Output":"for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire."}
{"Input":"one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,","Output":"\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will"}
{"Input":"It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will","Output":"not be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play."}
{"Input":"of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have","Output":"gone so entirely out of my head.\""}
{"Input":"\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;","Output":"\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never"}
{"Input":"\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"","Output":"\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth."}
{"Input":"She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.","Output":"Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself"}

{"Input":"strong felicity.  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list,","Output":"Lady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed"}
{"Input":"little curiosity beyond.","Output":"\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,"}
{"Input":"They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,","Output":"(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party"}
{"Input":"excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.","Output":"In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;"}
{"Input":"which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing","Output":"his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him"}

{"Input":"in her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,","Output":"yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,"}
{"Input":"that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer","Output":"her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be"}

{"Input":"In the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,","Output":"and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these"}
{"Input":"desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,","Output":"as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at"}

{"Input":"alter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more","Output":"at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;","Output":"but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing."}
{"Input":"the woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,","Output":"with sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description."}
{"Input":"Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,","Output":"I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\""}
{"Input":"that they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind","Output":"a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\""}
{"Input":"there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,","Output":"the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,"}
{"Input":"He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,","Output":"replied, as if in cool deliberation--"}
{"Input":"Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.","Output":"He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;"}
{"Input":"which they afterwards felt on his account.","Output":"His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury"}

{"Input":"benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.","Output":"\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;"}
{"Input":"\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.","Output":"\"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not"}
{"Input":"and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise","Output":"even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him."}
{"Input":"A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,","Output":"and I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,"}
{"Input":"excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know","Output":"you do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,"}
{"Input":"But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be","Output":"added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money."}
{"Input":"every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away","Output":"from Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,"}
{"Input":"so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have","Output":"an object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you."}
{"Input":"she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,","Output":"it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear"}
{"Input":"Anne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea","Output":"of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,"}
{"Input":"and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,","Output":"gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment."}
{"Input":"to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.","Output":"The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,"}
{"Input":"The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes","Output":"to his character.\""}
{"Input":"though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,","Output":"only two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on"}
{"Input":"better than nothing, and her spirits improved.","Output":"After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,"}
{"Input":"such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival","Output":"of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with"}

{"Input":"\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville","Output":"and all her family to Plymouth.\""}
{"Input":"though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.","Output":"They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what"}
{"Input":"She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks","Output":"all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason"}
{"Input":"to his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot","Output":"could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,"}
{"Input":"but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,","Output":"and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend"}
{"Input":"which may be just as well performed by another person?  And at Lyme too,","Output":"only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,"}
{"Input":"to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,","Output":"I have nothing to trouble you with.\""}
{"Input":"honesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,","Output":"a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,"}
{"Input":"were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.","Output":"His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion"}
{"Input":"you will agree with me.\"","Output":"\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling."}
{"Input":"a moment's regret.  But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her,","Output":"he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,"}
{"Input":"akin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure","Output":"that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly."}
{"Input":"She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,","Output":"and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--"}
{"Input":"Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how","Output":"the poor Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her."}
{"Input":"of the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for","Output":"the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,"}
{"Input":"and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,","Output":"but he would not tell."}
{"Input":"It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,","Output":"might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta."}
{"Input":"why she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,","Output":"(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,"}
{"Input":"the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of","Output":"Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,"}
{"Input":"had been completely in the old English style, containing only","Output":"two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;"}
{"Input":"a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,","Output":"a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity."}
{"Input":"were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.","Output":"Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--"}
{"Input":"A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman","Output":"so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,"}
{"Input":"\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"","Output":"\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up."}
{"Input":"the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--","Output":"was it not all against me?\""}
{"Input":"She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a","Output":"dangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong."}
{"Input":"just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat","Output":"very much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,"}
{"Input":"after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,","Output":"seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,"}
{"Input":"and this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,","Output":"and you wanted nothing beyond.\""}
{"Input":"was a very sore aggravation.","Output":"Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt"}
{"Input":"bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys","Output":"were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,"}
{"Input":"but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;","Output":"somebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning."}
{"Input":"Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.","Output":"It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house"}
{"Input":"both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,","Output":"and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;"}
{"Input":"them had ceased.","Output":"This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval"}
{"Input":"which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"","Output":"Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired."}
{"Input":"replied, as if in cool deliberation--","Output":"\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time."}
{"Input":"brought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation","Output":"put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape"}
{"Input":"on intimate terms in Camden Place.","Output":"Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,"}
{"Input":"all that could dim her sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor's wife,","Output":"but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession"}
{"Input":"She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.","Output":"They were too much like joy, senseless joy!"}
{"Input":"to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within","Output":"the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up"}
{"Input":"Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;","Output":"she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared"}
{"Input":"the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being","Output":"nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;"}
{"Input":"every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must","Output":"do both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,"}
{"Input":"too much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,","Output":"it is very fit she should have him.\""}
{"Input":"to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;","Output":"he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\""}
{"Input":"his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness","Output":"which a son-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited"}
{"Input":"the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's","Output":"feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's"}
{"Input":"which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.","Output":"When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be"}
{"Input":"and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.","Output":"She had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive"}
{"Input":"but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.","Output":"Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with"}
{"Input":"a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,","Output":"and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening."}
{"Input":"solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,","Output":"mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,"}
{"Input":"Take a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged","Output":"to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more","Output":"of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go"}
{"Input":"but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,","Output":"not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit"}
{"Input":"\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth.","Output":"\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary,"}
{"Input":"She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested","Output":"attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady"}
{"Input":"of being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.","Output":"She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of"}
{"Input":"somebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.","Output":"The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might"}
{"Input":"at Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),","Output":"\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\""}
{"Input":"in coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you","Output":"to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands"}
{"Input":"quite as soon as Louisa's.  \"And a very good living it was,\"","Output":"Charles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,"}
{"Input":"a single preliminary difference to modify of all that","Output":"\"This indenture sheweth.\""}
{"Input":"\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which","Output":"burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.","Output":"The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple"}
{"Input":"to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it","Output":"by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before."}
{"Input":"that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman","Output":"he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,"}
{"Input":"\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--","Output":"of the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have"}
{"Input":"I could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,","Output":"and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first"}
{"Input":"which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart","Output":"for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,"}
{"Input":"\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.","Output":"I happened to be at Lyme.\""}
{"Input":"and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.","Output":"She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,"}
{"Input":"urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same","Output":"stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,"}
{"Input":"and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner","Output":"not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,"}
{"Input":"except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,","Output":"but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,"}
{"Input":"rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"","Output":"Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,"}
{"Input":"occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think","Output":"he could have caught."}
{"Input":"it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.","Output":"The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove"}
{"Input":"It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.","Output":"Of course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,"}
{"Input":"She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,","Output":"it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them."}
{"Input":"You misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of","Output":"some man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;"}
{"Input":"I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit","Output":"than anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother"}
{"Input":"against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by","Output":"his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,"}
{"Input":"and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other","Output":"in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,"}
{"Input":"I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\"","Output":"(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of"}
{"Input":"\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been","Output":"introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,"}
{"Input":"She had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive","Output":"and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;"}
{"Input":"It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,","Output":"end in love with some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,"}
{"Input":"in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,","Output":"he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had"}
{"Input":"of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour","Output":"with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,"}
{"Input":"\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?","Output":"Take a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged"}
{"Input":"could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne","Output":"was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings."}
{"Input":"as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all","Output":"that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,"}
{"Input":"by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.","Output":"Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when"}
{"Input":"--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.","Output":"I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know"}
{"Input":"a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!","Output":"they were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!"}
{"Input":"able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,","Output":"and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different."}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;","Output":"probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,"}
{"Input":"was to be added.\"","Output":"\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself"}
{"Input":"whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from","Output":"conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity."}
{"Input":"are inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady","Output":"till to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire","Output":"was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening."}
{"Input":"should prevent as far as they can.\"","Output":"Anne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application"}
{"Input":"enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree","Output":"trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire,"}
{"Input":"\"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"","Output":"\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\""}
{"Input":"had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration","Output":"of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with"}
{"Input":"than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him","Output":"a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy"}
{"Input":"distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending","Output":"some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction"}
{"Input":"or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;","Output":"and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone,"}
{"Input":"equal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\"","Output":"\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--"}
{"Input":"How mortifying to feel that it was so!","Output":"Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"They had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.","Output":"He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him."}
{"Input":"to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,","Output":"which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way."}
{"Input":"\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending","Output":"the whole evening away from the poor boy?\""}
{"Input":"as cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,","Output":"in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot"}
{"Input":"\"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me","Output":"to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding"}
{"Input":"Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.","Output":"His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything."}
{"Input":"for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth","Output":"may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt"}
{"Input":"seemed to be staring in astonishment.","Output":"The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,"}
{"Input":"mutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,","Output":"I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect"}
{"Input":"were principally such as were wont to be always interesting:","Output":"praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.","Output":"I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man."}
{"Input":"who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,","Output":"to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,"}
{"Input":"\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?","Output":"The Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?\""}
{"Input":"I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are","Output":"particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it","Output":"a week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite."}
{"Input":"from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularly pleasing,","Output":"and I will answer for it, they would generally please.\""}
{"Input":"but always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she","Output":"pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in"}
{"Input":"of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's","Output":"state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick"}
{"Input":"in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;","Output":"in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself."}
{"Input":"Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,","Output":"to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen"}
{"Input":"He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;","Output":"said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,"}
{"Input":"but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice","Output":"Mrs Clay's freckles.\""}
{"Input":"that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,","Output":"and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;"}
{"Input":"being released from him; some one was taking him from her,","Output":"though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands"}
{"Input":"will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)","Output":"in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\""}
{"Input":"with an interest which never failed.  This was the page at which","Output":"the favourite volume always opened:"}
{"Input":"so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other","Output":"of being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained."}
{"Input":"That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say","Output":"a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;"}
{"Input":"A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:","Output":"but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),"}
{"Input":"Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which","Output":"we can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first"}
{"Input":"no possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said","Output":"with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible."}
{"Input":"I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\"","Output":"After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--"}
{"Input":"had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at","Output":"Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority."}
{"Input":"for your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,","Output":"\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us."}
{"Input":"they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must","Output":"make her happier."}
{"Input":"and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.","Output":"We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\""}
{"Input":"\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,","Output":"except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,"}
{"Input":"of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.","Output":"He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,"}
{"Input":"but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days","Output":"after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,"}
{"Input":"at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;","Output":"but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost"}
{"Input":"its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful","Output":"line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what"}

{"Input":"Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,","Output":"he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction."}

{"Input":"and could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased","Output":"her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands."}
{"Input":"He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.","Output":"Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,"}
{"Input":"At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house","Output":"could have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other"}

{"Input":"in the Christmas holidays.\"","Output":"Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;"}
{"Input":"from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were","Output":"at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath"}

{"Input":"\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"","Output":"and he was gone directly."}
{"Input":"I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been","Output":"strong disgust.\""}

{"Input":"He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;","Output":"and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour"}
{"Input":"\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words","Output":"which could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice"}
{"Input":"When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,","Output":"at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,"}
{"Input":"for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"","Output":"And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering"}

{"Input":"who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,","Output":"following their own pursuits, and living on their own property,"}
{"Input":"in misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of","Output":"throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,"}

{"Input":"I admire her more than her sister.\"","Output":"\"Oh! so do I.\""}

{"Input":"being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters","Output":"went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her"}
{"Input":"but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,","Output":"is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being"}

{"Input":"of the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have","Output":"nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions,"}
{"Input":"involved in a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--\"","Output":"\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her"}
{"Input":"might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;","Output":"for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit"}
{"Input":"Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half and hour's solitude","Output":"and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only"}
{"Input":"a great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character","Output":"was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree"}
{"Input":"\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\"","Output":"said Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing"}
{"Input":"having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall","Output":"in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,"}
{"Input":"in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,","Output":"meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should."}
{"Input":"to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered","Output":"an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation"}

{"Input":"should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.","Output":"That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you."}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.","Output":"I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired"}
{"Input":"you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.","Output":"Is he coming, Louisa?\""}
{"Input":"Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove","Output":"of Uppercross.\""}
{"Input":"of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.","Output":"Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation"}
{"Input":"and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them","Output":"to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away."}
{"Input":"invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.","Output":"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,"}
{"Input":"what you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,","Output":"when the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,"}
{"Input":"and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred","Output":"to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what"}
{"Input":"but that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"","Output":"\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can"}
{"Input":"\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!","Output":"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay","Output":"as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of"}
{"Input":"for half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine","Output":"young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;"}
{"Input":"had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers","Output":"and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--"}
{"Input":"Anne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and","Output":"confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine"}
{"Input":"it might be a very happy one.\"","Output":"\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects"}
{"Input":"that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house","Output":"which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support."}
{"Input":"to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,","Output":"I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,"}
{"Input":"to \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding","Output":"so hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,"}
{"Input":"Do not forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to be","Output":"a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,"}
{"Input":"introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\"","Output":"and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,"}
{"Input":"that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,","Output":"that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,"}
{"Input":"she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;","Output":"for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed"}
{"Input":"and safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be","Output":"misled by others to his ruin.\""}
{"Input":"gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification","Output":"for her own."}
{"Input":"said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,","Output":"enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons"}
{"Input":"Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution","Output":"of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,"}
{"Input":"submitted to an amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"","Output":"After waiting another moment--"}
{"Input":"finding her better at night.","Output":"Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--"}
{"Input":"young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter","Output":"all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.","Output":"He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;"}
{"Input":"of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--","Output":"\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,"}
{"Input":"Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long","Output":"he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not"}
{"Input":"way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.","Output":"His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,"}
{"Input":"on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.","Output":"Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed"}
{"Input":"He was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,","Output":"what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;"}
{"Input":"She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,","Output":"she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,"}
{"Input":"Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,","Output":"and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\""}
{"Input":"hardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments","Output":"he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,"}
{"Input":"Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money,","Output":"but their marriages had made a material difference in"}
{"Input":"from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!","Output":"He had passed out of the room without a look!"}

{"Input":"the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,","Output":"as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,"}
{"Input":"with somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy must write,","Output":"and beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure."}
{"Input":"had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,","Output":"or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real"}
{"Input":"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,","Output":"nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with"}
{"Input":"The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter","Output":"proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,"}
{"Input":"no one in particular.\"","Output":"\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,"}
{"Input":"for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be","Output":"most interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them"}
{"Input":"The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,","Output":"accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,","Output":"and so light of heart, they had passed along."}
{"Input":"Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard","Output":"Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if"}
{"Input":"the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,","Output":"but now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of"}

{"Input":"on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out","Output":"the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough"}
{"Input":"question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were","Output":"reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude"}
{"Input":"Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that","Output":"she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;"}
{"Input":"now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,","Output":"there is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,"}
{"Input":"The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him","Output":"as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table."}
{"Input":"and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair","Output":"of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,"}
{"Input":"for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,","Output":"round the orchestra, of course.\""}
{"Input":"Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,","Output":"so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,"}
{"Input":"Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing","Output":"very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it."}
{"Input":"was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.","Output":"She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him"}
{"Input":"almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:","Output":"the work of an instant!"}
{"Input":"any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated","Output":"as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep"}
{"Input":"and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's","Output":"history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions"}
{"Input":"He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by","Output":"his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness"}
{"Input":"charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome","Output":"Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"","Output":"Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity"}
{"Input":"Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house","Output":"in September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of"}
{"Input":"its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of","Output":"between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,"}
{"Input":"for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;","Output":"the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,"}
{"Input":"between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room","Output":"was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,"}
{"Input":"Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off","Output":"to the West Indies.\""}
{"Input":"(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.","Output":"I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy"}
{"Input":"she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely","Output":"to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,"}
{"Input":"Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough","Output":"to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,"}

{"Input":"at the time.\"","Output":"She assured him that she had not."}
{"Input":"from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it","Output":"in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross."}
{"Input":"I suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.","Output":"But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,"}
{"Input":"who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.","Output":"I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery."}
{"Input":"down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick","Output":"to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick"}
{"Input":"He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;","Output":"and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course"}

{"Input":"The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,","Output":"or men of any other description, can have had such a range;"}
{"Input":"express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably","Output":"in the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend"}
{"Input":"Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.","Output":"Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it"}
{"Input":"is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?","Output":"Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in"}
{"Input":"and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general","Output":"to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished"}
{"Input":"I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her","Output":"at the concert.  Something so formal and arrange in her air!"}
{"Input":"from his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring","Output":"in town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?"}
{"Input":"to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,","Output":"very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend"}
{"Input":"(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister's card yesterday,","Output":"and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;"}
{"Input":"applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's","Output":"present state with proper interest."}
{"Input":"but their marriages had made a material difference in","Output":"their degree of consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own,"}

{"Input":"handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation","Output":"and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance,"}
{"Input":"Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.","Output":"Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough"}
{"Input":"thinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,","Output":"whether there may not have been one person more my enemy"}
{"Input":"While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their","Output":"good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance"}
{"Input":"as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice","Output":"or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness"}
{"Input":"\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,","Output":"for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,"}
{"Input":"she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.","Output":"I had known you by character, however, long before.\""}
{"Input":"Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she","Output":"received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds"}
{"Input":"her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different","Output":"were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),"}
{"Input":"for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,","Output":"in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,"}
{"Input":"except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear","Output":"they have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother"}
{"Input":"which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye","Output":"which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,"}

{"Input":"but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all","Output":"knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,"}
{"Input":"Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared","Output":"for the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished."}
{"Input":"pretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than","Output":"two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,"}
{"Input":"as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become","Output":"precious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,"}

{"Input":"and who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names","Output":"are to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?"}
{"Input":"Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,","Output":"but without an idea that they would be carried round to her."}
{"Input":"a man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,","Output":"and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that"}
{"Input":"to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.","Output":"\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it."}
{"Input":"of another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.","Output":"She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always"}
{"Input":"Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been","Output":"very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation"}
{"Input":"and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,","Output":"that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,"}

{"Input":"could have done.","Output":"As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style"}
{"Input":"She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged","Output":"to plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see"}

{"Input":"she could not be quite herself.","Output":"She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!"}
{"Input":"as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.","Output":"\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour."}
{"Input":"and sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,","Output":"the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,"}

{"Input":"of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;","Output":"and this property, though not large, would be enough to make"}
{"Input":"no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.","Output":"He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot"}
{"Input":"it had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had","Output":"some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought"}
{"Input":"correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.","Output":"He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,"}
{"Input":"looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's.","Output":"A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:"}
{"Input":"he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot' and he had","Output":"`been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had"}
{"Input":"nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions,","Output":"and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband."}
{"Input":"that there was complete internal recognition on each side;","Output":"she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,"}

{"Input":"She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter","Output":"and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves,"}
{"Input":"Of course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,","Output":"and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have"}
{"Input":"in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,","Output":"but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta"}
{"Input":"in September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of","Output":"its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade"}
{"Input":"but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with","Output":"money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,"}
{"Input":"every blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils","Output":"and just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,"}
{"Input":"his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;","Output":"and when the horses were baited, he was off."}
{"Input":"he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do","Output":"to support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home"}
{"Input":"he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined","Output":"I will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,"}
{"Input":"She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish","Output":"of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern"}
{"Input":"Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman","Output":"who lived at Monkford:  Mrs Croft's brother?\""}
{"Input":"some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure","Output":"while she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,"}
{"Input":"another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter","Output":"and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been"}
{"Input":"that is what I call good company.\"","Output":"\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;"}

{"Input":"of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment","Output":"rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness."}
{"Input":"I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased","Output":"with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad"}
{"Input":"some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville","Output":"and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\""}
{"Input":"to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,","Output":"would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem"}
{"Input":"his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,","Output":"he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman"}

{"Input":"\"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too","Output":"piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,"}
{"Input":"such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent","Output":"the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,"}
{"Input":"a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.","Output":"\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,"}
{"Input":"and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for","Output":"at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;"}
{"Input":"In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever","Output":"have the precedence."}
{"Input":"till to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,","Output":"but that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\""}
{"Input":"Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.","Output":"They are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,"}
{"Input":"and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone,","Output":"that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of"}
{"Input":"being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,","Output":"and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of"}
{"Input":"and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books","Output":"on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,"}
{"Input":"and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,","Output":"her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together"}
{"Input":"Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,","Output":"was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging."}
{"Input":"but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--","Output":"\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see"}
{"Input":"the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,","Output":"a little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,"}
{"Input":"He was full of `to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been","Output":"full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension"}
{"Input":"accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;","Output":"and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend"}
{"Input":"as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.","Output":"She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,"}
{"Input":"but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required","Output":"in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,"}
{"Input":"the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--","Output":"that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort."}
{"Input":"from what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;","Output":"and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her"}
{"Input":"at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,","Output":"as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all"}
{"Input":"my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,","Output":"of course it is done.\""}
{"Input":"So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.","Output":"She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness"}
{"Input":"one should have known him by the livery.\"","Output":"\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\""}
{"Input":"to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,","Output":"and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\""}
{"Input":"two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,","Output":"which is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,"}
{"Input":"and she too little.","Output":"These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating"}
{"Input":"on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good","Output":"as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it."}
{"Input":"but for her birth.","Output":"Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet"}
{"Input":"\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,","Output":"that I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;"}
{"Input":"of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending","Output":"question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were"}
{"Input":"no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think","Output":"that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,"}
{"Input":"with his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,","Output":"and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was"}
{"Input":"made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.","Output":"She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice"}
{"Input":"It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,","Output":"and then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:"}
{"Input":"and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,","Output":"or the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was"}
{"Input":"She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,","Output":"who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle"}
{"Input":"without corresponding indignation.","Output":"Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to"}
{"Input":"Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's,","Output":"and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural"}
{"Input":"Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you","Output":"to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door."}
{"Input":"neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.","Output":"The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,"}
{"Input":"perhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary","Output":"circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which"}
{"Input":"so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,","Output":"that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove"}
{"Input":"or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,","Output":"at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,"}
{"Input":"had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,","Output":"thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him;"}
{"Input":"flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in","Output":"those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in"}
{"Input":"was set to right.  But even then there was something odd in their","Output":"way of going on.  Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,"}
{"Input":"Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;","Output":"but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise","Output":"I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished."}
{"Input":"He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are","Output":"bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of."}
{"Input":"that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,","Output":"a greater right to influence him, than is really the case."}

{"Input":"the greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,","Output":"many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him."}
{"Input":"He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.","Output":"There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes"}
{"Input":"which depends so entirely upon place.\"","Output":"\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural."}
{"Input":"were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family","Output":"but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire"}
{"Input":"that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,","Output":"and he had not courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour,"}
{"Input":"and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,","Output":"so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were","Output":"in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable"}
{"Input":"As to the management of their children, his theory was much better","Output":"than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them"}
{"Input":"make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it","Output":"very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being"}
{"Input":"as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal","Output":"of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties."}
{"Input":"removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--","Output":"how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part"}
{"Input":"of Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much","Output":"of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching"}
{"Input":"to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because","Output":"Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety"}
{"Input":"spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.","Output":"For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen."}
{"Input":"while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was","Output":"the most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over."}
{"Input":"mourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune","Output":"and promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;"}

{"Input":"first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given","Output":"to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare."}
{"Input":"his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth","Output":"was already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,"}
{"Input":"And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man","Output":"save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities"}
{"Input":"Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense,","Output":"was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away."}
{"Input":"Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,","Output":"and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,"}
{"Input":"and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have","Output":"a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should"}
{"Input":"there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a","Output":"distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and"}

{"Input":"in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night;","Output":"he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\""}
{"Input":"but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!","Output":"She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings"}
{"Input":"I shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood","Output":"cannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa."}
{"Input":"in the discredit of it.","Output":"Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted"}
{"Input":"or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,","Output":"recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well."}
{"Input":"We have it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter","Output":"from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it"}
{"Input":"She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant","Output":"or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin"}
{"Input":"suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles","Output":"to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain"}
{"Input":"and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.","Output":"She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority."}

{"Input":"and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,","Output":"to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of"}

{"Input":"in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey","Output":"Miss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but"}
{"Input":"to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.","Output":"I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,"}
{"Input":"at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits","Output":"to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,"}
{"Input":"after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,","Output":"for going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,"}
{"Input":"so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,","Output":"so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,"}
{"Input":"in the course of the first evening they spent together:","Output":"and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason"}
{"Input":"they had their value.  Anne smiled and said,","Output":"\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,"}
{"Input":"the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while","Output":"Anne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,"}
{"Input":"in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?","Output":"Shall I take any message?\""}
{"Input":"and she sits so upright!  My best love, of course.\"","Output":"\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,"}
{"Input":"She did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction","Output":"to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware"}
{"Input":"rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.","Output":"Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care"}
{"Input":"But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.","Output":"I will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak."}
{"Input":"with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward","Output":"to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,"}

{"Input":"her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it","Output":"she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both"}
{"Input":"and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card","Output":"in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,"}
{"Input":"\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little","Output":"thoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects"}
{"Input":"Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions","Output":"were at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way"}
{"Input":"as we go along.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not","Output":"feel comfortable if I have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!\""}
{"Input":"had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.","Output":"It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,"}
{"Input":"that her father had judged so well as to give him that","Output":"simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time"}
{"Input":"for the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity","Output":"of being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing"}
{"Input":"and so light of heart, they had passed along.","Output":"They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them."}
{"Input":"going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.","Output":"I was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up"}
{"Input":"by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,","Output":"in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have"}
{"Input":"of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully","Output":"of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood"}
{"Input":"that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,","Output":"that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,"}
{"Input":"Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\"","Output":"and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which"}
{"Input":"to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds","Output":"he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,"}
{"Input":"If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that","Output":"it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk."}
{"Input":"They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;","Output":"but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication"}
{"Input":"to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,","Output":"who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not"}
{"Input":"or farther up the town?\"","Output":"\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised."}
{"Input":"but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,","Output":"and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since","Output":"I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of"}
{"Input":"about my dear child.\"","Output":"The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,"}
{"Input":"pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can","Output":"but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him"}
{"Input":"nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare","Output":"I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\""}
{"Input":"of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go","Output":"was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out."}
{"Input":"for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you","Output":"why she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,"}
{"Input":"but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what","Output":"he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now."}
{"Input":"\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"","Output":"\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints"}
{"Input":"and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books","Output":"before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,"}
{"Input":"but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia","Output":"had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her"}
{"Input":"was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,","Output":"the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been"}
{"Input":"precious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,","Output":"and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;"}
{"Input":"and a right to spend it as he liked.","Output":"As to the management of their children, his theory was much better"}
{"Input":"with Admiral and Mrs Croft's compliments.","Output":"The Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her."}
{"Input":"Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age","Output":"of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness"}
{"Input":"to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,","Output":"Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.","Output":"He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are"}
{"Input":"should happen?\"","Output":"The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day."}
{"Input":"After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--","Output":"\"Do you mean that she refused him?\""}
{"Input":"pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been","Output":"a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's"}
{"Input":"not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect","Output":"to her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it"}
{"Input":"to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,","Output":"and act as circumstances might require."}
{"Input":"when she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,","Output":"and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage"}
{"Input":"buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under","Output":"year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,"}
{"Input":"agreeable to others?","Output":"She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting."}
{"Input":"she certainly had not.","Output":"\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft."}
{"Input":"We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,","Output":"for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth."}
{"Input":"said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,","Output":"that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance."}
{"Input":"received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds","Output":"immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial."}
{"Input":"the name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer","Output":"for everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain"}
{"Input":"that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,","Output":"how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable"}
{"Input":"in Captain Wentworth's affection.  His profession was all that could ever","Output":"make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war"}
{"Input":"often saying, `Was this for me?'\"","Output":"Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,"}
{"Input":"an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even","Output":"in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing"}
{"Input":"There were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates","Output":"to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief."}
{"Input":"of having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself;","Output":"of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,"}
{"Input":"It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;","Output":"and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again"}
{"Input":"and found practicable so soon.","Output":"They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all"}
{"Input":"in all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry","Output":"that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,"}
{"Input":"had made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath","Output":"on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,"}
{"Input":"to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart","Output":"beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks"}
{"Input":"and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;","Output":"and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,"}
{"Input":"Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,","Output":"and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,"}
{"Input":"the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up","Output":"the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,"}
{"Input":"This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been","Output":"anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years"}
{"Input":"and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.","Output":"I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted"}
{"Input":"rather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,","Output":"was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through"}
{"Input":"on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which","Output":"determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion."}
{"Input":"too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found","Output":"an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,"}
{"Input":"that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish","Output":"the worth of volumes.\""}
{"Input":"and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,","Output":"is but a state of half enjoyment."}
{"Input":"He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,","Output":"my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,"}
{"Input":"A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,","Output":"where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough"}
{"Input":"spoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known","Output":"in Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted."}
{"Input":"use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;","Output":"and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,"}
{"Input":"\"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;","Output":"your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine."}
{"Input":"a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from","Output":"some of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country."}
{"Input":"and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,","Output":"added--"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.","Output":"They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,"}
{"Input":"being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage","Output":"were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window"}
{"Input":"acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,","Output":"let him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed"}
{"Input":"used to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her","Output":"with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement"}
{"Input":"Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back","Output":"of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for"}
{"Input":"and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.","Output":"He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,"}
{"Input":"to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands","Output":"upon your time.\""}
{"Input":"of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines","Output":"which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,"}
{"Input":"A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by","Output":"her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy"}
{"Input":"think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on","Output":"Mr Elliot's good fortune.\""}
{"Input":"in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,","Output":"the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb,"}
{"Input":"in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,","Output":"that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all"}
{"Input":"would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;","Output":"a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs"}
{"Input":"Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,","Output":"and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer"}
{"Input":"very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;","Output":"she would as lieve be tossed out as not.\""}
{"Input":"so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable","Output":"portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now."}
{"Input":"and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly","Output":"in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,"}
{"Input":"she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have","Output":"called on Mrs Smith."}
{"Input":"were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.","Output":"They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think","Output":"it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health,"}
{"Input":"that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,","Output":"hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached"}
{"Input":"She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,","Output":"followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne"}
{"Input":"the highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not","Output":"think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,"}
{"Input":"as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,","Output":"Captain Wentworth walking down the street."}
{"Input":"would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.","Output":"After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,"}
{"Input":"Chapter 3","Output":"\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd"}
{"Input":"such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener","Output":"to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her"}
{"Input":"that I never go near.\"","Output":"Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,"}
{"Input":"his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.","Output":"This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before."}
{"Input":"anything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had","Output":"little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection"}
{"Input":"she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,","Output":"but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced"}
{"Input":"great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.","Output":"Chapter 17"}
{"Input":"of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,","Output":"though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too."}
{"Input":"In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,","Output":"and Anne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine"}
{"Input":"and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match","Output":"should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence."}
{"Input":"at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly,","Output":"from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter"}
{"Input":"of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after","Output":"taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck"}
{"Input":"for directions.","Output":"\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?"}
{"Input":"\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.","Output":"It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves."}
{"Input":"They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--","Output":"\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her"}
{"Input":"she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.","Output":"It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,"}
{"Input":"their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;","Output":"they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad."}
{"Input":"Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to","Output":"think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on"}
{"Input":"their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,","Output":"that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;"}
{"Input":"with a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it","Output":"as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance"}
{"Input":"self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,","Output":"\"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon."}
{"Input":"played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which","Output":"always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove"}
{"Input":"They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;","Output":"and yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid's room,"}
{"Input":"from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter","Output":"which she had afterwards spent there with herself."}
{"Input":"if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable","Output":"curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment"}
{"Input":"was Lady Russell's kind answer.","Output":"\"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather"}
{"Input":"She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.","Output":"His regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole"}
{"Input":"Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom","Output":"behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without"}
{"Input":"His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,","Output":"has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\""}
{"Input":"and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent","Output":"as she chose."}
{"Input":"Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted","Output":"to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things"}
{"Input":"steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;","Output":"for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\""}
{"Input":"painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,","Output":"she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy"}
{"Input":"nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than","Output":"forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,"}
{"Input":"Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for","Output":"my former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?"}
{"Input":"nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it","Output":"to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only"}
{"Input":"than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get","Output":"a special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\""}
{"Input":"must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well","Output":"as the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,"}
{"Input":"wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,","Output":"travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off"}
{"Input":"but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `Why, to be sure,","Output":"ma'am,' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'"}
{"Input":"at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.","Output":"Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough"}
{"Input":"and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence","Output":"in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,"}
{"Input":"Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;","Output":"and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,"}
{"Input":"could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume","Output":"into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud"}
{"Input":"a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme","Output":"had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to"}
{"Input":"by the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,","Output":"and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental"}
{"Input":"I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.","Output":"There were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates"}
{"Input":"They did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen","Output":"to her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;"}
{"Input":"It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had","Output":"never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,"}
{"Input":"of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they","Output":"have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants"}
{"Input":"that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.","Output":"Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,"}
{"Input":"though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be","Output":"so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness."}
{"Input":"on the side of the Great House family, which was generally,","Output":"as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was"}
{"Input":"and constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable","Output":"of everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal"}
{"Input":"There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;","Output":"and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,"}
{"Input":"Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal","Output":"from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,"}
{"Input":"\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"","Output":"continued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,"}
{"Input":"All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely","Output":"connected herself with an old country family of respectability and"}
{"Input":"and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,","Output":"and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,"}
{"Input":"\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.","Output":"\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to"}
{"Input":"Here Anne had often been staying.  She knew the ways of Uppercross","Output":"as well as those of Kellynch.  The two families were so continually meeting,"}
{"Input":"He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open","Output":"to dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect."}
{"Input":"to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to","Output":"all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have"}
{"Input":"in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,","Output":"and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might"}
{"Input":"Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.","Output":"She could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,"}
{"Input":"to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself","Output":"the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend"}
{"Input":"They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others","Output":"began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,"}
{"Input":"the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last","Output":"into making her the wife of Sir William."}
{"Input":"or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.","Output":"There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;"}
{"Input":"the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's","Output":"usual state of mind."}
{"Input":"Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted","Output":"also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story."}
{"Input":"nor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to","Output":"the value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;"}
{"Input":"in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,","Output":"as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,"}
{"Input":"I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single","Output":"so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were"}
{"Input":"that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,","Output":"bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct"}
{"Input":"when they cease to be quite young.\"","Output":"It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak"}
{"Input":"very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be","Output":"left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\""}
{"Input":"\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.","Output":"Captain Harville has no thought but of going.\""}
{"Input":"of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without","Output":"risk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others."}
{"Input":"which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.","Output":"It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend"}
{"Input":"they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,","Output":"of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,"}
{"Input":"of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been","Output":"merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence."}
{"Input":"Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this","Output":"break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was"}

{"Input":"than marrying among the Hayters.\"","Output":"Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared"}
{"Input":"penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing","Output":"something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can"}
{"Input":"and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see","Output":"if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;"}
{"Input":"A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,","Output":"but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,"}
{"Input":"of Mr Elliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.","Output":"Chapter 21"}

{"Input":"come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with","Output":"Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  No second attachment,"}
{"Input":"recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.","Output":"But now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms"}
{"Input":"who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has","Output":"a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed."}
{"Input":"Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,","Output":"could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne"}
{"Input":"\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.","Output":"\"Can you really?\""}
{"Input":"and of hopes.","Output":"There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment"}
{"Input":"of enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,","Output":"that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty"}
{"Input":"Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course","Output":"she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening."}
{"Input":"excepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,","Output":"when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--"}
{"Input":"on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,","Output":"and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,","Output":"but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties"}
{"Input":"\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.","Output":"It is early.\""}
{"Input":"and to that party of the three which boasted least animation,","Output":"and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles"}
{"Input":"using any thing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\"","Output":"he supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\""}
{"Input":"from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her","Output":"there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened.  It was transient:"}
{"Input":"Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject,","Output":"by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened"}
{"Input":"\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.","Output":"I have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should"}
{"Input":"of course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of","Output":"Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,"}
{"Input":"you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there","Output":"must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her"}
{"Input":"\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,","Output":"\"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything"}
{"Input":"He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,","Output":"mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell"}
{"Input":"and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,","Output":"which they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\""}

{"Input":"be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once","Output":"in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of"}
{"Input":"mischievous kind.","Output":"\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay,"}
{"Input":"charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;","Output":"she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was"}
{"Input":"to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,","Output":"who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself"}

{"Input":"\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me","Output":"quite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all."}
{"Input":"\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be","Output":"a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles"}
{"Input":"opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;","Output":"and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.","Output":"\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:"}
{"Input":"His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene","Output":"she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place."}
{"Input":"for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,","Output":"and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means"}
{"Input":"he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that","Output":"he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war."}
{"Input":"of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.","Output":"Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them"}
{"Input":"quite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.","Output":"You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use."}
{"Input":"said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness","Output":"to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his"}
{"Input":"No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where","Output":"she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description"}
{"Input":"and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,","Output":"he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;"}
{"Input":"very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter","Output":"had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth"}
{"Input":"It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;","Output":"and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,"}
{"Input":"Chapter 5","Output":"On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch Hall,"}
{"Input":"large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.","Output":"She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant"}
{"Input":"on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty","Output":"of something more permanent long before the term in question,"}
{"Input":"I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,","Output":"but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia"}

{"Input":"for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain","Output":"in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions"}
{"Input":"the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives","Output":"could bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings"}
{"Input":"and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd","Output":"in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey"}
{"Input":"There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,","Output":"and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,"}
{"Input":"that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty","Output":"at Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),"}
{"Input":"when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.","Output":"She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate."}
{"Input":"that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.","Output":"Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,"}
{"Input":"\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.","Output":"A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman"}
{"Input":"\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,","Output":"if you will give me materials.\""}
{"Input":"for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when","Output":"they are over, and he is safe back again.\""}
{"Input":"and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless","Output":"slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,"}
{"Input":"I could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you","Output":"very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,"}
{"Input":"you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding","Output":"and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on."}
{"Input":"of the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter","Output":"wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,"}
{"Input":"and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend","Output":"Lady Russell's doing, that she did not.  They think Charles"}
{"Input":"into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must unquestionably","Output":"have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded"}
{"Input":"as they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,","Output":"but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice"}
{"Input":"of unfounded news.\"","Output":"Mrs Smith said nothing."}
{"Input":"in order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that","Output":"such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,"}
{"Input":"by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself","Output":"from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope"}
{"Input":"and act as circumstances might require.","Output":"\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy."}
{"Input":"will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.","Output":"She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers","Output":"in her father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,"}
{"Input":"Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.","Output":"It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than"}
{"Input":"The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,","Output":"again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;"}
{"Input":"of the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,","Output":"that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his"}
{"Input":"Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.","Output":"\"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock."}
{"Input":"give his daughter at present but a small part of the share","Output":"of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter."}
{"Input":"No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect","Output":"had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot"}
{"Input":"She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth","Output":"once more, without the interchange of one friendly look."}
{"Input":"beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not","Output":"think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this"}
{"Input":"in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.","Output":"Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded."}
{"Input":"When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,","Output":"but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt."}
{"Input":"she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.","Output":"Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,"}
{"Input":"\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has","Output":"a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from"}
{"Input":"a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"Good morning to you!\"","Output":"being all that she had time for, as she passed away."}
{"Input":"but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of","Output":"himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--"}
{"Input":"in the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend","Output":"and praise him!\""}
{"Input":"Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,","Output":"by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would."}
{"Input":"when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something","Output":"to his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects."}
{"Input":"her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,","Output":"she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way."}
{"Input":"whose landed property and general importance were second in that country,","Output":"only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance;"}
{"Input":"Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.","Output":"This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech"}
{"Input":"to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henrietta","Output":"had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation."}
{"Input":"what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of","Output":"any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated"}
{"Input":"but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,","Output":"young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter"}

{"Input":"and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,","Output":"where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot"}
{"Input":"It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred","Output":"on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished"}
{"Input":"this evening or never.\"","Output":"Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half and hour's solitude"}
{"Input":"and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,","Output":"and feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.","Output":"There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,"}
{"Input":"and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street","Output":"she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing"}
{"Input":"line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what","Output":"the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,"}
{"Input":"you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in","Output":"and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\""}
{"Input":"The girls looked all amazement.","Output":"\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,"}
{"Input":"as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.","Output":"A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture"}
{"Input":"in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!","Output":"Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her"}
{"Input":"I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"","Output":"He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised"}
{"Input":"good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,","Output":"for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style."}
{"Input":"and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,","Output":"from the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated"}
{"Input":"to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.","Output":"Chapter 15"}
{"Input":"as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted","Output":"eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being"}
{"Input":"eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith","Output":"should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have"}
{"Input":"and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.","Output":"Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture"}
{"Input":"in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot","Output":"about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him."}
{"Input":"Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.","Output":"Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was"}
{"Input":"the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves","Output":"out of their way.\""}
{"Input":"Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility","Output":"of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea"}
{"Input":"She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of","Output":"the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,"}
{"Input":"additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just","Output":"high enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\""}
{"Input":"It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak","Output":"Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant,"}
{"Input":"--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy","Output":"for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to"}
{"Input":"suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.","Output":"If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that"}
{"Input":"in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest","Output":"symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias"}
{"Input":"to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that","Output":"he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude"}
{"Input":"\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"","Output":"The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;"}
{"Input":"my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"","Output":"\"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy"}
{"Input":"she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.","Output":"Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa"}
{"Input":"and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me","Output":"in love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,"}
{"Input":"for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head,","Output":"is not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,"}
{"Input":"and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.","Output":"As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said"}
{"Input":"does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"","Output":"\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur"}
{"Input":"of her own life.","Output":"Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings"}
{"Input":"\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when","Output":"you called yesterday?\""}
{"Input":"nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness","Output":"at home."}
{"Input":"Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility","Output":"to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything."}
{"Input":"One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there","Output":"was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,"}
{"Input":"in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes","Output":"had its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone"}
{"Input":"Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in","Output":"Camden Place could have passed so well!"}
{"Input":"You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.","Output":"You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship."}
{"Input":"all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands","Output":"of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry."}
{"Input":"could be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,","Output":"all his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour"}
{"Input":"and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had","Output":"already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,"}
{"Input":"\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least","Output":"put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;"}
{"Input":"walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready","Output":"to do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\""}
{"Input":"This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,","Output":"his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act"}
{"Input":"She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk","Output":"of spending the morning in Rivers Street."}
{"Input":"The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.","Output":"Her own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,"}
{"Input":"on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"","Output":"Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out"}
{"Input":"\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air","Output":"than one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\""}
{"Input":"for I do not know what they should wait for.\"","Output":"\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne,"}
{"Input":"She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,","Output":"in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,"}
{"Input":"After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,","Output":"their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,"}
{"Input":"than one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"","Output":"\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;"}
{"Input":"\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;","Output":"\"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,"}
{"Input":"Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment","Output":"of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I"}
{"Input":"but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon","Output":"as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived"}
{"Input":"and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage","Output":"of Lady Russell's journey."}
{"Input":"to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,","Output":"they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but"}
{"Input":"only nodded in reply, and walked away.","Output":"The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give","Output":"a general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked"}
{"Input":"as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.","Output":"They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;"}
{"Input":"The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,","Output":"in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,"}
{"Input":"rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.","Output":"And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,"}
{"Input":"half a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses","Output":"to any one.\""}
{"Input":"some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could","Output":"never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear."}
{"Input":"liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.","Output":"She never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,"}
{"Input":"trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.","Output":"He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by"}
{"Input":"She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,","Output":"but now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference"}
{"Input":"I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.","Output":"I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed"}
{"Input":"How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted","Output":"as cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,"}
{"Input":"which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little","Output":"variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday"}
{"Input":"a small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"","Output":"\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\""}
{"Input":"of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with","Output":"her prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate"}
{"Input":"and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"","Output":"\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men"}
{"Input":"with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad","Output":"to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking"}
{"Input":"I can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,","Output":"rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\""}
{"Input":"the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.","Output":"He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\""}
{"Input":"by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement","Output":"with Benwick."}
{"Input":"made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely","Output":"to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near"}
{"Input":"on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others","Output":"all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,"}
{"Input":"but which had been followed by so many, many years of division","Output":"and estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,"}
{"Input":"More than seven years were gone since this little history","Output":"of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had"}
{"Input":"their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having","Output":"more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;"}
{"Input":"on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,","Output":"for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\""}
{"Input":"highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:","Output":"she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in"}
{"Input":"\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\"","Output":"cried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me."}
{"Input":"to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish","Output":"every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away"}
{"Input":"and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.","Output":"Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender"}
{"Input":"\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as","Output":"he was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta"}
{"Input":"to any thing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,","Output":"sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be"}
{"Input":"and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,","Output":"might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it"}
{"Input":"This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;","Output":"and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and"}
{"Input":"\"that's all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall","Output":"be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken"}
{"Input":"superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"","Output":"\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any"}
{"Input":"many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.","Output":"She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea"}
{"Input":"to Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace","Output":"turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,"}
{"Input":"How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;","Output":"what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee."}
{"Input":"The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;","Output":"though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies"}
{"Input":"be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"","Output":"\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims."}
{"Input":"united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt","Output":"an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even"}
{"Input":"but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession","Output":"which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues"}
{"Input":"tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.","Output":"He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis"}
{"Input":"his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action","Output":"off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,"}
{"Input":"\"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?\"","Output":"\"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there."}
{"Input":"In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder","Output":"how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,"}
{"Input":"whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.","Output":"Anne could command herself enough to receive that look,"}
{"Input":"it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.","Output":"There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits"}
{"Input":"seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,","Output":"when they saw him coming after them, with three companions,"}
{"Input":"for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.","Output":"The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was"}
{"Input":"that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,","Output":"would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,"}
{"Input":"that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick","Output":"should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\""}
{"Input":"Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.","Output":"Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,"}
{"Input":"He stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him","Output":"some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks"}
{"Input":"Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful,","Output":"and amused also that the course of events and the new interests"}
{"Input":"could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,","Output":"every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant."}
{"Input":"there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--","Output":"which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize."}
{"Input":"but never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.","Output":"For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?"}
{"Input":"to meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,","Output":"and could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased"}
{"Input":"command a home with Lady Russell.","Output":"Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial"}
{"Input":"and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering","Output":"to go with the others."}
{"Input":"all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part","Output":"must follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;"}
{"Input":"He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath","Output":"in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of"}
{"Input":"former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;","Output":"they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement"}
{"Input":"from the awful impression of its being dissolved.","Output":"However it might end, he was without any question their"}
{"Input":"\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;","Output":"that is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,"}
{"Input":"in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy","Output":"and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all"}
{"Input":"against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation","Output":"of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,"}
{"Input":"Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.","Output":"She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to"}
{"Input":"and his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense","Output":"and consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed"}
{"Input":"it was all Bath.","Output":"They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered"}
{"Input":"is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being","Output":"always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard"}
{"Input":"It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,","Output":"felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present."}
{"Input":"that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness","Output":"as a very resolute character."}
{"Input":"would have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"","Output":"\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not."}
{"Input":"All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;","Output":"more than perhaps--\""}
{"Input":"no harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been","Output":"esteemed about equal."}
{"Input":"as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,","Output":"and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances."}
{"Input":"She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.","Output":"The country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;"}
{"Input":"the little way our road lies together.  I am going home.\"","Output":"\"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes"}
{"Input":"\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.","Output":"Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,"}
{"Input":"I hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it","Output":"over to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)"}
{"Input":"He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct","Output":"must refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;"}
{"Input":"so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of","Output":"her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself."}
{"Input":"as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.","Output":"Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified"}
{"Input":"they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;","Output":"and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted"}
{"Input":"Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance","Output":"which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,"}
{"Input":"a rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,","Output":"Lady Russell's politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter"}
{"Input":"happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,","Output":"blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order"}
{"Input":"might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,","Output":"be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth"}

{"Input":"to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood","Output":"see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?"}
{"Input":"of the other all generous attachment.","Output":"Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room."}
{"Input":"He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft","Output":"seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk"}

{"Input":"How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had","Output":"another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,","Output":"she breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment"}
{"Input":"The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back","Output":"from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw"}
{"Input":"and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.","Output":"She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,"}
{"Input":"Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,","Output":"as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,"}
{"Input":"The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest","Output":"in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes"}
{"Input":"enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons","Output":"and voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself"}
{"Input":"having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind","Output":"which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye"}
{"Input":"The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.","Output":"We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,"}
{"Input":"by her father, had disappointed her.","Output":"She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,"}
{"Input":"A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;","Output":"but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `Why, to be sure,"}
{"Input":"\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be","Output":"a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;"}
{"Input":"going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box","Output":"which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\""}
{"Input":"Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful","Output":"for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain"}
{"Input":"in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such","Output":"as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to"}

{"Input":"\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information","Output":"in such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands"}
{"Input":"He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.","Output":"Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in"}

{"Input":"and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly","Output":"were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly."}
{"Input":"of a very different description.","Output":"She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her"}
{"Input":"that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time","Output":"since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had"}
{"Input":"to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome;","Output":"and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House,"}
{"Input":"of a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying","Output":"that she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases"}
{"Input":"\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\"","Output":"was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter's;"}
{"Input":"could not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort","Output":"of life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--"}
{"Input":"with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and","Output":"fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;"}
{"Input":"resigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care,","Output":"and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity."}
{"Input":"to propose a little walk.","Output":"\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose"}
{"Input":"evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined","Output":"a little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,","Output":"the sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been"}

{"Input":"\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,","Output":"and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove"}

{"Input":"former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;","Output":"but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and"}

{"Input":"most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.","Output":"It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of"}

{"Input":"If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;","Output":"but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\""}
{"Input":"\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,","Output":"Mrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad"}
{"Input":"and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.","Output":"Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,"}
{"Input":"knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished","Output":"house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised"}
{"Input":"They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted","Output":"to come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,"}

{"Input":"the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked","Output":"nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:"}
{"Input":"marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;","Output":"and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick"}
{"Input":"was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.","Output":"As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence"}
{"Input":"in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself","Output":"to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances"}
{"Input":"\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home","Output":"than you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,"}
{"Input":"With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,","Output":"it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,"}
{"Input":"to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"","Output":"\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter."}
{"Input":"She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.","Output":"It was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew"}
{"Input":"if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.","Output":"He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have"}
{"Input":"neither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly","Output":"they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,"}
{"Input":"to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.","Output":"From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal,"}
{"Input":"equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of","Output":"bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money."}
{"Input":"\"We have made very few changes either,\" continued the Admiral,","Output":"after thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,"}
{"Input":"on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,","Output":"living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself"}
{"Input":"too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together","Output":"in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently"}
{"Input":"had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.","Output":"\"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,\"--"}
{"Input":"respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest","Output":"being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,"}
{"Input":"and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.","Output":"So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\""}
{"Input":"\"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;","Output":"though many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic"}
{"Input":"Every minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off","Output":"for Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\""}
{"Input":"\"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.","Output":"\"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow"}
{"Input":"to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.","Output":"But Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,"}
{"Input":"elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting","Output":"more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,"}

{"Input":"that she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,","Output":"an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,"}
{"Input":"ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He had left the country","Output":"in consequence."}
{"Input":"She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that","Output":"such things had been."}
{"Input":"\"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"","Output":"said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,"}
{"Input":"any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,","Output":"or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne."}
{"Input":"The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day","Output":"at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits"}
{"Input":"recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.","Output":"The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,"}
{"Input":"(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party","Output":"to the window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle,"}
{"Input":"Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in","Output":"the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;"}
{"Input":"Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?","Output":"Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him"}
{"Input":"\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,","Output":"I know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;"}
{"Input":"was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,","Output":"when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,"}
{"Input":"A little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,","Output":"Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that"}
{"Input":"accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.","Output":"There had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,"}
{"Input":"as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent","Output":"some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure"}
{"Input":"poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation","Output":"not having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,"}
{"Input":"lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.","Output":"At present, believe me, I have no need of your services,"}
{"Input":"the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,","Output":"amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,"}
{"Input":"\"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling.","Output":"\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,\""}
{"Input":"she had determined to make her own absence from home begin","Output":"when she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,"}
{"Input":"I am no card-player.\"","Output":"\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;"}
{"Input":"to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;","Output":"or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,"}
{"Input":"in the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing","Output":"and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,"}
{"Input":"drawing-rooms.","Output":"Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal."}
{"Input":"at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both","Output":"the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation."}
{"Input":"her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.","Output":"Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter"}
{"Input":"and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.","Output":"She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a"}

{"Input":"She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,","Output":"rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;"}
{"Input":"I think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"","Output":"Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that"}
{"Input":"for wondering at it.'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,","Output":"that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself."}
{"Input":"might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding","Output":"might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,"}
{"Input":"one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),","Output":"prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake."}
{"Input":"Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,","Output":"I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something"}
{"Input":"beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks","Output":"when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free."}
{"Input":"the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,","Output":"the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,"}
{"Input":"he will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have","Output":"the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,"}
{"Input":"and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which","Output":"may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville"}

{"Input":"was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,","Output":"and she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination"}
{"Input":"and leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been","Output":"an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--"}
{"Input":"it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream","Output":"is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings"}
{"Input":"of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,","Output":"as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of."}
{"Input":"whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children","Output":"from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side"}
{"Input":"On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,","Output":"and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone"}

{"Input":"\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds","Output":"of objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons"}
{"Input":"`been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had","Output":"promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come."}
{"Input":"and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,","Output":"one should have known him by the livery.\""}
{"Input":"in the house if you like it.\"","Output":"\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\""}
{"Input":"and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell","Output":"she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,"}
{"Input":"to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy","Output":"to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted","Output":"tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,"}
{"Input":"Charles Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other","Output":"almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross."}
{"Input":"Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness","Output":"for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary"}
{"Input":"more than most men.\"","Output":"Chapter 8"}
{"Input":"without apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,","Output":"however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly"}

{"Input":"To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least","Output":"better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to"}

{"Input":"from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.","Output":"It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied"}

{"Input":"and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured","Output":"to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,"}
{"Input":"Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope","Output":"to see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been"}
{"Input":"she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of being prudent,","Output":"and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,"}
{"Input":"Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.","Output":"She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within"}
{"Input":"had made really an agreeable fortnight.","Output":"Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary's face was clouded directly."}
{"Input":"and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove","Output":"as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,"}
{"Input":"to add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,","Output":"offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,"}
{"Input":"in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have","Output":"been difficulties."}

{"Input":"at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons","Output":"for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again."}
{"Input":"With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,","Output":"there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been"}
{"Input":"of you not to come on Thursday.\"","Output":"\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!"}
{"Input":"finish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people","Output":"as a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against"}
{"Input":"or follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,","Output":"will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house"}
{"Input":"He knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"","Output":"Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently","Output":"not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end"}
{"Input":"not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted","Output":"a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;"}
{"Input":"We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in","Output":"my father's great barns; and he played his part so well"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,","Output":"for she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine"}
{"Input":"and feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have","Output":"been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;"}
{"Input":"to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding","Output":"that I may not have many more visits from you.\""}
{"Input":"very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being","Output":"conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting"}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,","Output":"hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,"}
{"Input":"and though Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state","Output":"as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied"}
{"Input":"I will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.","Output":"He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,"}
{"Input":"\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit","Output":"of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender."}
{"Input":"with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,","Output":"and sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,"}
{"Input":"and not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,","Output":"and the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side."}
{"Input":"The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going","Output":"six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;"}
{"Input":"in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have","Output":"suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,"}
{"Input":"for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being","Output":"his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy"}
{"Input":"the tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change","Output":"as implying less.  He must love her."}
{"Input":"She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of","Output":"his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks"}
{"Input":"to change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better","Output":"not be attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled"}
{"Input":"even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.","Output":"The news of his cousins Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot"}
{"Input":"connected herself with an old country family of respectability and","Output":"large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:"}
{"Input":"Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove","Output":"relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,"}

{"Input":"though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able","Output":"to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,"}
{"Input":"going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?","Output":"I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to"}
{"Input":"he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as","Output":"he meant to see finally adopted."}
{"Input":"a something between delight and misery.","Output":"He spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner"}
{"Input":"but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.","Output":"So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same."}
{"Input":"as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing","Output":"to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty"}
{"Input":"an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,","Output":"and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,"}
{"Input":"Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes","Output":"fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad"}
{"Input":"recollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable","Output":"that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was"}
{"Input":"which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur","Output":"which so flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning;"}
{"Input":"a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy","Output":"of the interest which he had been beginning to excite."}
{"Input":"When this was told, his name distressed her no longer.","Output":"Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,"}
{"Input":"and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;","Output":"put her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;"}
{"Input":"\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have","Output":"suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you"}
{"Input":"She was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,","Output":"almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,"}
{"Input":"to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was","Output":"not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard"}
{"Input":"He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.","Output":"He was full of `to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been"}
{"Input":"her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy","Output":"and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,"}
{"Input":"far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced","Output":"themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions"}
{"Input":"set off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,","Output":"to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;"}
{"Input":"of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration","Output":"of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all"}
{"Input":"the independence which alone had been wanting.","Output":"Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,"}
{"Input":"Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked","Output":"to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave."}
{"Input":"He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa","Output":"could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,"}
{"Input":"obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay","Output":"had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,"}
{"Input":"and want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"","Output":"(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,"}
{"Input":"The young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked","Output":"of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;"}
{"Input":"to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick","Output":"seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch."}
{"Input":"Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles","Output":"walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready"}

{"Input":"one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always","Output":"be company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;"}
{"Input":"and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;","Output":"and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice"}
{"Input":"have done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;","Output":"and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,"}
{"Input":"She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.","Output":"Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference"}
{"Input":"would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;","Output":"said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman."}
{"Input":"will always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"","Output":"\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome"}
{"Input":"no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,","Output":"with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably"}
{"Input":"to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been","Output":"doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place"}
{"Input":"with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes,","Output":"I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\""}
{"Input":"and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height","Output":"of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,"}
{"Input":"escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them","Output":"a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,"}
{"Input":"\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;","Output":"and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,"}
{"Input":"would improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.","Output":"The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood"}
{"Input":"for what he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street","Output":"to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,"}
{"Input":"said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.","Output":"Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all"}
{"Input":"Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself","Output":"into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,"}
{"Input":"with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,","Output":"had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,"}
{"Input":"consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation","Output":"for all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt"}
{"Input":"of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man","Output":"for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose"}

{"Input":"so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure","Output":"of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,"}
{"Input":"Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be","Output":"left to be guessed.  Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened"}
{"Input":"which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.","Output":"From that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner"}
{"Input":"and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been","Output":"much in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,"}
{"Input":"it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.","Output":"When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called"}
{"Input":"full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,","Output":"and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted."}
{"Input":"daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,","Output":"liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match."}
{"Input":"to dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.","Output":"I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,"}
{"Input":"had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,","Output":"making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of"}

{"Input":"She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,","Output":"and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,"}
{"Input":"It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been","Output":"done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,"}
{"Input":"They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,","Output":"on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never"}
{"Input":"so far as to say--","Output":"\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\""}
{"Input":"from the heads of the inn.","Output":"Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened"}
{"Input":"for three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might","Output":"sit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\""}
{"Input":"though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours","Output":"and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash"}
{"Input":"which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;","Output":"and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow."}
{"Input":"did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:","Output":"and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;"}

{"Input":"and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"","Output":"\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word."}
{"Input":"and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,","Output":"her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly"}
{"Input":"\"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,\"","Output":"was Lady Russell's kind answer."}
{"Input":"The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him","Output":"before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine."}
{"Input":"but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous","Output":"for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what"}
{"Input":"a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature","Output":"to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;"}
{"Input":"There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both","Output":"occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time."}
{"Input":"as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance","Output":"in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation."}
{"Input":"to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.","Output":"She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it","Output":"much serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of"}
{"Input":"bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal","Output":"to add.  In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,"}

{"Input":"Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only","Output":"the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's"}
{"Input":"as a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,","Output":"for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when"}
{"Input":"She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings","Output":"towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;"}
{"Input":"from being cut out by one artful woman, at least.","Output":"Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,"}
{"Input":"which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --","Output":"\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take"}
{"Input":"place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important","Output":"at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath"}
{"Input":"When she could let her attention take its natural course again,","Output":"she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List"}
{"Input":"and of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not","Output":"be dwelling upon such gloomy things.\""}
{"Input":"\"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur","Output":"from beginning to end.\""}
{"Input":"the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;","Output":"and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be"}

{"Input":"his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,","Output":"and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to"}
{"Input":"seemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends","Output":"were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with"}

{"Input":"and I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,","Output":"who has had no society among women to make him nice?\""}
{"Input":"for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had","Output":"gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was"}
{"Input":"satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document","Output":"of former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad"}
{"Input":"comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.","Output":"Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going."}
{"Input":"which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance","Output":"of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage."}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a secret,)--","Output":"accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,"}
{"Input":"they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable","Output":"they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,"}
{"Input":"will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house","Output":"this evening or never.\""}
{"Input":"with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,","Output":"\"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected,"}
{"Input":"to let me get you a chair.\"","Output":"She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating"}
{"Input":"We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.","Output":"You are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,"}
{"Input":"\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,","Output":"\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\""}
{"Input":"that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions","Output":"as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion"}
{"Input":"though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,","Output":"Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed"}
{"Input":"There were more completely popular.","Output":"The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,"}
{"Input":"and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.","Output":"Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,"}
{"Input":"with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which","Output":"he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings."}
{"Input":"who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and","Output":"listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought"}
{"Input":"such a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"","Output":"\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well"}
{"Input":"They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.","Output":"He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft"}
{"Input":"\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well","Output":"was quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief"}
{"Input":"of doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,","Output":"might yet be made observant by it."}
{"Input":"and rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,","Output":"I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single"}
{"Input":"without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,","Output":"and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage"}
{"Input":"much the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.","Output":"Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and"}

{"Input":"as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!","Output":"If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,"}
{"Input":"had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened","Output":"her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference."}
{"Input":"Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out","Output":"a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early."}
{"Input":"She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.","Output":"He did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him"}
{"Input":"quickly and permanently.","Output":"Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,"}
{"Input":"\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I","Output":"made money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise"}
{"Input":"if she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously","Output":"on this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy"}
{"Input":"of its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter","Output":"what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement"}
{"Input":"I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of","Output":"will be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot."}
{"Input":"if we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your","Output":"Queen Squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--"}
{"Input":"You see how it has carried away her freckles.\"","Output":"If Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise"}
{"Input":"They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,","Output":"dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;"}
{"Input":"and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became","Output":"a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen."}
{"Input":"but most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation","Output":"was given to the two present, and promised for the absent,"}
{"Input":"to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.","Output":"It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits"}
{"Input":"to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,","Output":"and saying to Captain Wentworth--"}
{"Input":"Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,","Output":"but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity"}
{"Input":"He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye","Output":"spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was"}
{"Input":"when Anne eagerly suggested--","Output":"\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?"}
{"Input":"This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,","Output":"staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping."}
{"Input":"and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course","Output":"I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities"}

{"Input":"and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be","Output":"seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;"}
{"Input":"an object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.","Output":"All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;"}
{"Input":"to explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have","Output":"a general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;"}
{"Input":"at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --","Output":"\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was"}
{"Input":"to have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than","Output":"a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;"}
{"Input":"But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,","Output":"prose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you"}
{"Input":"which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,","Output":"who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,"}
{"Input":"through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,","Output":"that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded"}
{"Input":"of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood","Output":"he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own."}
{"Input":"\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her","Output":"natural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers"}
{"Input":"and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,","Output":"in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such"}
{"Input":"and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;","Output":"while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,"}
{"Input":"full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension","Output":"of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have"}
{"Input":"in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.","Output":"Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing"}
{"Input":"in the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together","Output":"at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer"}
{"Input":"Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,","Output":"and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,"}
{"Input":"said Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,","Output":"and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,"}
{"Input":"came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused;","Output":"they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space"}
{"Input":"to be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,","Output":"that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you,"}
{"Input":"Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter","Output":"might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,"}
{"Input":"in his cousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him","Output":"to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish"}
{"Input":"that the object only had been deficient.","Output":"\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you"}
{"Input":"as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,","Output":"and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless."}
{"Input":"agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how","Output":"to understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\""}
{"Input":"a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures.","Output":"I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,"}
{"Input":"and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief","Output":"he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed."}
{"Input":"\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,","Output":"when you promised to go.\""}
{"Input":"any recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority","Output":"of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;"}
{"Input":"hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,","Output":"as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!"}
{"Input":"due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then","Output":"at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased"}
{"Input":"there was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not","Output":"be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's,"}
{"Input":"and do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what","Output":"Lady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had"}
{"Input":"\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home","Output":"(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment."}

{"Input":"Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt","Output":"that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough"}
{"Input":"his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy","Output":"to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it"}
{"Input":"and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed","Output":"coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it"}
{"Input":"to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear","Output":"of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command"}
{"Input":"It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal","Output":"from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence"}

{"Input":"consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,","Output":"fail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,"}
{"Input":"might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.","Output":"Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister."}
{"Input":"without seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,","Output":"steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;"}
{"Input":"She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact","Output":"so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father"}
{"Input":"of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth","Output":"was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy."}
{"Input":"at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;","Output":"seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence"}
{"Input":"some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,","Output":"and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,"}
{"Input":"to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,","Output":"such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters"}
{"Input":"of strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,","Output":"she had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,"}
{"Input":"In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,","Output":"and the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed"}
{"Input":"As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,","Output":"and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,"}
{"Input":"accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired","Output":"the name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer"}
{"Input":"in the other room.  `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was no end","Output":"of Miss Elliot's charms.\""}
{"Input":"an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,","Output":"which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,"}

{"Input":"he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,","Output":"that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;"}
{"Input":"a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"","Output":"\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore"}
{"Input":"but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.","Output":"Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;"}
{"Input":"The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--","Output":"\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,"}
{"Input":"side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest","Output":"and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,"}

{"Input":"the smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\"","Output":"One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there"}

{"Input":"\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,","Output":"long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye"}
{"Input":"for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being","Output":"to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\""}
{"Input":"It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied","Output":"in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--"}
{"Input":"under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return","Output":"of indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding"}
{"Input":"Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father","Output":"and sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh"}
{"Input":"and sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh","Output":"that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see"}
{"Input":"The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,","Output":"bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise"}
{"Input":"to be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.","Output":"\"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm","Output":"than any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,"}
{"Input":"and change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,","Output":"and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;"}
{"Input":"and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her","Output":"quickly and permanently."}
{"Input":"to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.","Output":"Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,"}
{"Input":"Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could","Output":"so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked"}
{"Input":"and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,","Output":"and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;"}
{"Input":"as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,","Output":"she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,"}
{"Input":"was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,","Output":"it was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be"}
{"Input":"and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost","Output":"always together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style."}
{"Input":"that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all","Output":"the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer."}
{"Input":"\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.","Output":"I could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you"}
{"Input":"Louisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.","Output":"It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,"}
{"Input":"\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,","Output":"with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\""}
{"Input":"and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,","Output":"intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw"}
{"Input":"Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely","Output":"what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity"}
{"Input":"weakness and timidity.","Output":"He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either","Output":"could not or would not answer fully."}
{"Input":"must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,","Output":"and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,"}
{"Input":"but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.","Output":"The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way"}
{"Input":"by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners","Output":"had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them"}
{"Input":"Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.","Output":"I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is."}
{"Input":"answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being","Output":"\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\""}
{"Input":"lately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;","Output":"and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,"}
{"Input":"with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends","Output":"to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not"}
{"Input":"He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,","Output":"and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune."}
{"Input":"\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"","Output":"\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air"}
{"Input":"received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.","Output":"\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\""}
{"Input":"than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.","Output":"Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,"}
{"Input":"when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated","Output":"walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,"}
{"Input":"her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--","Output":"\"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,"}
{"Input":"but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced","Output":"to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within"}
{"Input":"His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury","Output":"received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas."}
{"Input":"but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had","Output":"the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,"}
{"Input":"to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished","Output":"for modesty to be natural in any other woman.\""}
{"Input":"his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth","Output":"proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;"}
{"Input":"She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,","Output":"and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing"}
{"Input":"of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her","Output":"to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits."}
{"Input":"and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves","Output":"on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze"}
{"Input":"with both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her","Output":"the better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,","Output":"the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while"}
{"Input":"in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have","Output":"passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him"}
{"Input":"at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason","Output":"why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place."}
{"Input":"by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits","Output":"were talked of."}
{"Input":"would move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,","Output":"and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared."}
{"Input":"of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of","Output":"his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain."}
{"Input":"Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,","Output":"and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,"}
{"Input":"\"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain","Output":"Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy."}
{"Input":"They were all at her disposal.","Output":"When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,"}
{"Input":"in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.","Output":"I fancy they are all at Uppercross.\""}
{"Input":"You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish","Output":"to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,"}
{"Input":"very much in the way.","Output":"Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,"}
{"Input":"It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.","Output":"We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;"}
{"Input":"two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him","Output":"had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there"}
{"Input":"When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was","Output":"not romancing so much as you supposed.\""}
{"Input":"and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt","Output":"and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top"}
{"Input":"Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which","Output":"she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse"}
{"Input":"the interference in any plan of their own.","Output":"\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\""}
{"Input":"So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,","Output":"containing nearly as much more."}
{"Input":"the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;","Output":"and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her"}
{"Input":"a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's","Output":"introduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,"}

{"Input":"in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.","Output":"She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;"}
{"Input":"that she had said so much, simple as it was.","Output":"Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,"}
{"Input":"\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!","Output":"That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our"}
{"Input":"when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.","Output":"A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found","Output":"anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress"}
{"Input":"said Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement","Output":"of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\""}
{"Input":"Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,","Output":"to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant"}
{"Input":"for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman","Output":"were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,"}
{"Input":"were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would","Output":"pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others"}
{"Input":"and escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern","Output":"and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes"}
{"Input":"It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,","Output":"after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with"}

{"Input":"The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;","Output":"I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,"}
{"Input":"This was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"","Output":"and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --"}
{"Input":"might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,","Output":"and when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding"}
{"Input":"is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all","Output":"equal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\""}
{"Input":"Charles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"","Output":"But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility"}
{"Input":"the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,","Output":"as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening"}
{"Input":"to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior","Output":"in cultivation and manners to all the rest."}
{"Input":"than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply","Output":"afflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition"}
{"Input":"in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,","Output":"had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them."}
{"Input":"that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,","Output":"grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,"}
{"Input":"and when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding","Output":"might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life"}
{"Input":"It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,","Output":"untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,"}
{"Input":"a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had","Output":"any better principle to guide him than selfishness.\""}
{"Input":"the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took","Output":"a hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,"}
{"Input":"\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery","Output":"at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant,","Output":"had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application"}
{"Input":"made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her","Output":"that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa."}
{"Input":"Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society","Output":"of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages"}
{"Input":"we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you","Output":"as we go along.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not"}
{"Input":"where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot","Output":"for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;"}
{"Input":"would but think so.\"","Output":"One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable"}
{"Input":"and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished","Output":"to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned"}
{"Input":"which she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen","Output":"and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them"}

{"Input":"and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,","Output":"at least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,"}
{"Input":"but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,","Output":"that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;"}
{"Input":"lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.","Output":"A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,"}

{"Input":"The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.","Output":"Chapter 7"}
{"Input":"Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.","Output":"In a low, cautious voice, he said: --"}

{"Input":"I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are","Output":"out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much"}
{"Input":"Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes","Output":"of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,"}

{"Input":"she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,","Output":"expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away"}
{"Input":"without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;","Output":"but still she did it, and not with much happier effect;"}

{"Input":"as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles","Output":"when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay."}
{"Input":"The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:","Output":"Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,"}

{"Input":"Mary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him","Output":"mention Anne twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne,"}
{"Input":"sooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering","Output":"might have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me."}
{"Input":"not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,","Output":"that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,"}
{"Input":"and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.","Output":"A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,"}
{"Input":"could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,","Output":"and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,"}
{"Input":"since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person","Output":"from what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne"}
{"Input":"in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,","Output":"moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;"}
{"Input":"to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter","Output":"and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,"}
{"Input":"The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came","Output":"with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;"}
{"Input":"before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.","Output":"So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,"}
{"Input":"to meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot","Output":"and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,"}
{"Input":"\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot","Output":"the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning."}
{"Input":"and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually","Output":"making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,"}
{"Input":"To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name","Output":"so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,"}
{"Input":"and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness","Output":"and the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything"}
{"Input":"of mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was","Output":"not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded"}
{"Input":"into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,","Output":"that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her."}
{"Input":"Chapter 12","Output":"Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party"}
{"Input":"I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.","Output":"I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\""}

{"Input":"to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,","Output":"from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:"}
{"Input":"\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I","Output":"shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,"}
{"Input":"of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was","Output":"not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they"}
{"Input":"Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,","Output":"Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne"}
{"Input":"That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our","Output":"mutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,"}
{"Input":"all the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,","Output":"he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,"}
{"Input":"I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of","Output":"in my own family.\""}
{"Input":"if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself","Output":"agreeable to others?"}
{"Input":"which could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice","Output":"that she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;"}

{"Input":"\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,","Output":"I have never been in the house above twice in my life.\""}
{"Input":"an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,","Output":"which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal"}
{"Input":"and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend","Output":"may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\""}
{"Input":"not much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had","Output":"more modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;"}
{"Input":"in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,","Output":"or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,"}
{"Input":"of your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,","Output":"buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under"}
{"Input":"of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!","Output":"Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,"}
{"Input":"but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!","Output":"Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,"}
{"Input":"\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,","Output":"\"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home."}
{"Input":"eager speech.  What Anne first heard was--","Output":"\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened"}
{"Input":"and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent","Output":"by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits"}
{"Input":"indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without","Output":"knowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?"}
{"Input":"his sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being","Output":"very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;"}
{"Input":"for he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already","Output":"acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,"}
{"Input":"The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:  the day was even fixed;","Output":"and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,"}
{"Input":"but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.","Output":"Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was"}
{"Input":"she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,","Output":"there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements"}
{"Input":"with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.","Output":"My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,"}
{"Input":"delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,","Output":"as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted"}
{"Input":"but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched","Output":"by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,"}
{"Input":"in the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister","Output":"were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,"}
{"Input":"to stay in Henrietta's stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?","Output":"And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!"}
{"Input":"on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.","Output":"There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse"}
{"Input":"and this property, though not large, would be enough to make","Output":"her comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it."}
{"Input":"and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again","Output":"by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely,"}
{"Input":"as well as those of Kellynch.  The two families were so continually meeting,","Output":"so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house"}
{"Input":"Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified","Output":"by the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married,"}
{"Input":"one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"","Output":"\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded"}
{"Input":"Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,","Output":"and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hoped"}
{"Input":"that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth","Output":"were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,"}
{"Input":"I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.","Output":"Was he at all such as he appears now?\""}
{"Input":"too little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society","Output":"would improve them.  She wanted her to be more known."}

{"Input":"they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,","Output":"who had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been"}

{"Input":"in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,","Output":"as good company, as those who would collect good company around them,"}
{"Input":"And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;","Output":"for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be"}
{"Input":"Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--","Output":"\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,"}
{"Input":"make her happier.","Output":"Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,"}
{"Input":"my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.","Output":"I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;"}
{"Input":"There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most","Output":"proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;"}

{"Input":"that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.","Output":"There must be the same immediate association of thought,"}
{"Input":"and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for","Output":"the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying,"}
{"Input":"ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions","Output":"being beyond those of other men.\""}
{"Input":"and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place.","Output":"He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;"}
{"Input":"Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,","Output":"without apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,"}
{"Input":"he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise","Output":"trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else."}
{"Input":"Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that","Output":"to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,"}
{"Input":"more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.","Output":"Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,"}
{"Input":"and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,","Output":"could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now"}
{"Input":"of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places,","Output":"or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters."}
{"Input":"full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;","Output":"and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,"}

{"Input":"while she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,","Output":"as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles"}
{"Input":"which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole","Output":"of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;"}

{"Input":"Your home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,","Output":"nor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\""}
{"Input":"he is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,","Output":"which may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse"}
{"Input":"It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was","Output":"startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined"}
{"Input":"\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,","Output":"or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;"}
{"Input":"and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity","Output":"of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation"}

{"Input":"of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,","Output":"could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft"}
{"Input":"Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence","Output":"of such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary"}
{"Input":"with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.","Output":"Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence."}
{"Input":"\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,\"","Output":"said Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,"}

{"Input":"some man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;","Output":"quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family."}
{"Input":"afflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition","Output":"as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings"}
{"Input":"of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage","Output":"of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,"}
{"Input":"You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.","Output":"I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her"}

{"Input":"but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought","Output":"in her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,"}
{"Input":"among the Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying,","Output":"warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more"}

{"Input":"and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them","Output":"will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)"}
{"Input":"\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"","Output":"then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,"}
{"Input":"that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom","Output":"you will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place"}
{"Input":"The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly","Output":"down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed,"}

{"Input":"but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something","Output":"to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town."}
{"Input":"and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.","Output":"She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,"}

{"Input":"common friends must be soon bringing them together again.","Output":"Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;"}
{"Input":"He truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family","Output":"are very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:"}
{"Input":"\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck","Output":"by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging."}
{"Input":"in their destination!  How unworthily occupied!  An ancient family","Output":"to be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\""}
{"Input":"for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.","Output":"Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,"}
{"Input":"How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,","Output":"was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;"}
{"Input":"The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove","Output":"was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile."}
{"Input":"by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,","Output":"every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must"}

{"Input":"that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you","Output":"the trouble of replying.\""}
{"Input":"to listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"","Output":"Anne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\""}
{"Input":"she might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;","Output":"but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours."}
{"Input":"\"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness","Output":"in coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you"}
{"Input":"It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.","Output":"We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us."}
{"Input":"left to be guessed.  Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened","Output":"by what she heard.  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,"}
{"Input":"quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.","Output":"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\""}
{"Input":"and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of","Output":"a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,"}
{"Input":"from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really","Output":"taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which"}
{"Input":"or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin","Output":"but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had"}
{"Input":"accordingly had been ruined.","Output":"The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it."}
{"Input":"could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose","Output":"when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne"}
{"Input":"The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying","Output":"her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,"}
{"Input":"Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball","Output":"of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs"}
{"Input":"and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.","Output":"Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,","Output":"when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must"}

{"Input":"some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks","Output":"and fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,"}
{"Input":"in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:","Output":"\"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath"}
{"Input":"they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.","Output":"It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards"}
{"Input":"but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period","Output":"he had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible"}
{"Input":"\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,","Output":"and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,"}
{"Input":"In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be","Output":"alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;"}
{"Input":"and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,","Output":"handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation"}
{"Input":"and Henrietta did seem to like him.","Output":"Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;"}
{"Input":"forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with","Output":"the arms and motto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county"}
{"Input":"When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called","Output":"in aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.","Output":"She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,"}
{"Input":"all his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour","Output":"had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path."}
{"Input":"to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness","Output":"of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value."}
{"Input":"that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"","Output":"Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called","Output":"a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth"}
{"Input":"as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.","Output":"In the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,"}
{"Input":"very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation","Output":"they created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,"}
{"Input":"but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,","Output":"with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow."}
{"Input":"with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value","Output":"for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of"}
{"Input":"Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination","Output":"to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds"}
{"Input":"with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make","Output":"the accommodations on board such as women ought to have."}
{"Input":"people begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,","Output":"when you are married.'  I can only say, `No, I shall not;' and then"}
{"Input":"and misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa","Output":"perfectly recovered now?\""}
{"Input":"You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"","Output":"Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much"}
{"Input":"living or dead.","Output":"He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals"}
{"Input":"like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions","Output":"and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel"}
{"Input":"caught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;","Output":"and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended"}
{"Input":"of who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished","Output":"than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity"}
{"Input":"at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.","Output":"The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day"}
{"Input":"the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,","Output":"and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,"}
{"Input":"Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.","Output":"Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up."}
{"Input":"idle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is","Output":"an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,"}
{"Input":"when you promised to go.\"","Output":"\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot was almost a first object.","Output":"She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of"}
{"Input":"and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of","Output":"indifference to her when she was called on to quit them."}
{"Input":"deeply in love.  It would be difficult to say which had seen","Output":"highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:"}
{"Input":"and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"","Output":"She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance"}
{"Input":"received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.","Output":"He must love somebody."}
{"Input":"this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.","Output":"He was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,"}
{"Input":"She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"","Output":"\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make"}
{"Input":"must understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,","Output":"to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence,"}
{"Input":"The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,","Output":"perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old"}
{"Input":"its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become","Output":"a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into."}
{"Input":"on the subject.","Output":"Chapter 14"}
{"Input":"shook her head, and exclaimed--","Output":"\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew"}
{"Input":"but time makes many changes.\"","Output":"\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she"}
{"Input":"I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,","Output":"indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,"}
{"Input":"Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much","Output":"so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--"}
{"Input":"more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;","Output":"and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,"}
{"Input":"he supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\"","Output":"and added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;"}
{"Input":"have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded","Output":"that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,"}
{"Input":"but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,","Output":"since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,"}
{"Input":"why should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;","Output":"it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been"}
{"Input":"It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied","Output":"with her situation, for a change is not very probable there."}
{"Input":"and devotion.","Output":"His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;"}
{"Input":"to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been","Output":"only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested"}
{"Input":"I know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;","Output":"for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,"}
{"Input":"She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to","Output":"Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her"}
{"Input":"Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.","Output":"You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men."}
{"Input":"\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,","Output":"turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,"}
{"Input":"This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet","Output":"better than nothing, and her spirits improved."}
{"Input":"Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed","Output":"such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,"}
{"Input":"These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied","Output":"and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;"}
{"Input":"had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into","Output":"greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death."}
{"Input":"to her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it","Output":"to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow"}
{"Input":"she told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived","Output":"a few years back at Monkford.  Bless me! what was his name?"}
{"Input":"It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend","Output":"as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,"}
{"Input":"\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.","Output":"His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,"}
{"Input":"for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;","Output":"there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such","Output":"ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions"}
{"Input":"to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections","Output":"to those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?"}
{"Input":"was already on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written,","Output":"he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him."}
{"Input":"though there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;","Output":"I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted"}
{"Input":"arguing the matter warmly.","Output":"Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution"}
{"Input":"She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired","Output":"by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together,"}
{"Input":"To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"","Output":"(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister's card yesterday,"}
{"Input":"\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry","Output":"towards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,"}
{"Input":"and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort","Output":"rather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,"}
{"Input":"so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,","Output":"have reason to reproach her for giving no warning."}
{"Input":"or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks","Output":"only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty"}
{"Input":"The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.","Output":"They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless."}
{"Input":"for Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"","Output":"Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away."}
{"Input":"of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.","Output":"\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;"}
{"Input":"An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,","Output":"zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,"}
{"Input":"So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall,","Output":"or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safe enough,"}
{"Input":"than you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,","Output":"I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like."}
{"Input":"over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one","Output":"drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think"}
{"Input":"Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself","Output":"to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that"}
{"Input":"prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,","Output":"and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to"}
{"Input":"feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's","Output":"dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,"}
{"Input":"and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm;","Output":"but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper"}
{"Input":"little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,","Output":"as she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was"}
{"Input":"one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"","Output":"\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville"}
{"Input":"By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,","Output":"Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired"}
{"Input":"a carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were","Output":"so crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;"}
{"Input":"(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of","Output":"the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\""}
{"Input":"of deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,","Output":"as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise"}
{"Input":"and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.","Output":"She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,"}
{"Input":"\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.","Output":"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family,"}
{"Input":"of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;","Output":"but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs"}
{"Input":"to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.  You know James Benwick.\"","Output":"\"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.\""}
{"Input":"\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"","Output":"said Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement"}
{"Input":"was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.","Output":"Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\""}
{"Input":"Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness","Output":"of some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been"}
{"Input":"said Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.","Output":"It must have been about the same time that he became known to"}
{"Input":"nor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was","Output":"all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part"}
{"Input":"he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.","Output":"By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,"}
{"Input":"he might choose to model his household.\"","Output":"Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more"}
{"Input":"we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has","Output":"a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;"}
{"Input":"It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,","Output":"and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd"}
{"Input":"which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances","Output":"(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such"}
{"Input":"Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,","Output":"fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report"}
{"Input":"the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,","Output":"and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical"}
{"Input":"though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare","Output":"of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad"}
{"Input":"yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought","Output":"of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,"}
{"Input":"who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle","Output":"close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,"}
{"Input":"to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer","Output":"place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important"}
{"Input":"Surely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.","Output":"Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine"}

{"Input":"in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her","Output":"in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain"}
{"Input":"he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money","Output":"as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice"}
{"Input":"till they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked","Output":"on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age.\""}
{"Input":"with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.","Output":"She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,"}
{"Input":"for longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused","Output":"as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?"}
{"Input":"eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,","Output":"removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--"}
{"Input":"a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,","Output":"and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne's;"}
{"Input":"of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.","Output":"How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always"}
{"Input":"and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,","Output":"eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith"}
{"Input":"you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing","Output":"in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;"}
{"Input":"and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;","Output":"and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,"}
{"Input":"conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.","Output":"She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him."}
{"Input":"a matter of course.  Though better endowed than the elder sister,","Output":"Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper.  While well, and happy,"}
{"Input":"Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,","Output":"which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;"}
{"Input":"followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne","Output":"perfectly knew the meaning of."}
{"Input":"well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;","Output":"that is what I call good company.\""}
{"Input":"she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,","Output":"of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,"}
{"Input":"\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.","Output":"Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\""}
{"Input":"from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,","Output":"will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea."}

{"Input":"a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party","Output":"all the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody."}
{"Input":"Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it","Output":"in Captain Wentworth's affection.  His profession was all that could ever"}
{"Input":"Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.","Output":"It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him"}
{"Input":"especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take","Output":"place of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,"}
{"Input":"to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something","Output":"occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of"}

{"Input":"of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great","Output":"that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when"}
{"Input":"to support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home","Output":"with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother."}
{"Input":"at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath","Output":"and London.\""}
{"Input":"compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity,","Output":"and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner"}
{"Input":"\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.","Output":"\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?"}
{"Input":"had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,","Output":"had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,"}
{"Input":"shewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,","Output":"a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you,"}
{"Input":"\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,","Output":"as if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there"}
{"Input":"to understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be","Output":"shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,"}
{"Input":"before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity","Output":"of a waiter."}

{"Input":"Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.","Output":"Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to"}
{"Input":"of Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?","Output":"He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain"}
{"Input":"She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;","Output":"felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very"}
{"Input":"in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot","Output":"thought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth preserving,"}
{"Input":"An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections","Output":"of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features"}
{"Input":"Chapter 13","Output":"The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,"}
{"Input":"The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience","Output":"of its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and","Output":"respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;"}

{"Input":"if I had not gone.\"","Output":"\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\""}
{"Input":"for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,","Output":"and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,"}

{"Input":"any claims of Charles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting","Output":"the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once."}
{"Input":"\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be","Output":"my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,"}

{"Input":"on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay","Output":"to have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself"}
{"Input":"been extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.","Output":"She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,"}

{"Input":"He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death,","Output":"Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures"}
{"Input":"\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband's answer, \"and I should be","Output":"very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be"}
{"Input":"both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm","Output":"to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,"}
{"Input":"She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of her heels,","Output":"as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the street,"}
{"Input":"the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean","Output":"to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,"}
{"Input":"who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,","Output":"again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded"}
{"Input":"and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,","Output":"I believe, several years.\""}
{"Input":"and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone","Output":"directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out"}
{"Input":"and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,","Output":"who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner"}
{"Input":"could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.","Output":"She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated"}
{"Input":"that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,","Output":"perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour"}
{"Input":"had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by","Output":"the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge"}
{"Input":"What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?\"","Output":"Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her."}
{"Input":"the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all","Output":"to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:"}
{"Input":"One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,","Output":"at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into"}
{"Input":"This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one","Output":"sooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering"}
{"Input":"six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;","Output":"of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's"}
{"Input":"anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress","Output":"you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!"}
{"Input":"my father's great barns; and he played his part so well","Output":"that I have liked him the better ever since.\""}
{"Input":"she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released","Output":"Captain Wentworth as well as herself."}
{"Input":"was very great.","Output":"\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward"}
{"Input":"for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,","Output":"Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,"}
{"Input":"I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,","Output":"trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants"}
{"Input":"following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had","Output":"heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,"}
{"Input":"she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,","Output":"the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received"}
{"Input":"Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,","Output":"either at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,"}
{"Input":"be continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe","Output":"the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable"}
{"Input":"her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,","Output":"and adding, \"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment,"}
{"Input":"the sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been","Output":"of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,"}
{"Input":"\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"","Output":"\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number"}
{"Input":"hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all","Output":"near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more."}
{"Input":"He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:","Output":"and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place."}
{"Input":"till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,","Output":"Louisa, and Captain Wentworth."}
{"Input":"\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any","Output":"brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything"}
{"Input":"such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,","Output":"which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,"}
{"Input":"and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.","Output":"This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties,"}
{"Input":"bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.","Output":"An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,"}
{"Input":"She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,","Output":"when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth"}
{"Input":"to their inn last night.  Mary had been hysterical again this morning.","Output":"When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,"}
{"Input":"But this was not all which they had to make them happy.","Output":"They had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot."}
{"Input":"\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;","Output":"and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,"}
{"Input":"and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.","Output":"They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love."}
{"Input":"they were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross","Output":"in the Christmas holidays.\""}
{"Input":"Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,","Output":"united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt"}
{"Input":"of the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with--","Output":"\"And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip."}
{"Input":"the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.","Output":"With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,"}
{"Input":"and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having","Output":"a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit"}
{"Input":"equally well, and who have always been such good friends,","Output":"the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--"}
{"Input":"here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,","Output":"that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment"}
{"Input":"This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech","Output":"of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,"}
{"Input":"how extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had","Output":"been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us."}
{"Input":"almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.","Output":"Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;"}
{"Input":"never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.","Output":"She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that"}
{"Input":"before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.","Output":"He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,"}
{"Input":"(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),","Output":"and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view"}
{"Input":"take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance","Output":"to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,"}
{"Input":"She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening","Output":"we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised"}
{"Input":"and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;","Output":"and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,"}
{"Input":"and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.","Output":"There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;"}
{"Input":"Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing","Output":"of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed"}
{"Input":"The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance","Output":"to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,"}
{"Input":"\"Ay, that we shall.\"","Output":"\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married"}
{"Input":"exerting himself, said--","Output":"\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute."}
{"Input":"actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed","Output":"which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart"}
{"Input":"the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries","Output":"provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,"}
{"Input":"a very odd young man.  I do not know what he would be at.","Output":"We asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook"}
{"Input":"\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,","Output":"you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson"}
{"Input":"and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves,","Output":"but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,"}
{"Input":"They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss","Output":"on the side of the Great House family, which was generally,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid","Output":"of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure"}
{"Input":"as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\"","Output":"and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable"}
{"Input":"but she had not courage to ask the question.","Output":"\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me."}
{"Input":"How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken","Output":"is of little consequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all:"}
{"Input":"at home.","Output":"Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her"}
{"Input":"to all who needed them.","Output":"Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,"}
{"Input":"there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.","Output":"My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish."}
{"Input":"and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,","Output":"advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was"}
{"Input":"but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves","Output":"susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though"}
{"Input":"of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad","Output":"of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,"}
{"Input":"\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,","Output":"when Anne eagerly suggested--"}
{"Input":"to give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of","Output":"his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent."}
{"Input":"it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear","Output":"the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return"}
{"Input":"money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,","Output":"and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say"}
{"Input":"of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed","Output":"right to be done."}
{"Input":"a reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her","Output":"what no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have"}
{"Input":"the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence","Output":"on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay"}
{"Input":"to make the worth of Lyme understood.","Output":"The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted"}
{"Input":"the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend","Output":"and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,"}
{"Input":"\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome","Output":"which depends so entirely upon place.\""}
{"Input":"and just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,","Output":"with a smile. \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune."}
{"Input":"of particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that","Output":"some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been"}
{"Input":"and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.","Output":"Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had"}
{"Input":"who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect","Output":"and devotion."}
{"Input":"We have seen nothing of him since November.  Even Sophy could","Output":"not understand it.  But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;"}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all","Output":"the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him"}
{"Input":"but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),","Output":"\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life."}
{"Input":"zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,","Output":"for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\""}
{"Input":"and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife","Output":"as they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon"}
{"Input":"only two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on","Output":"introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as"}
{"Input":"would ill bear examination.","Output":"Chapter 12"}
{"Input":"but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,","Output":"with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,"}
{"Input":"for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which","Output":"she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other."}
{"Input":"were to come in our way, Sir Walter--\"","Output":"\"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter;"}
{"Input":"of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,","Output":"through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions."}
{"Input":"It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,","Output":"within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,"}
{"Input":"against previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest","Output":"in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open"}
{"Input":"talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children","Output":"on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece."}
{"Input":"\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit","Output":"due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then"}
{"Input":"Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,","Output":"or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable."}
{"Input":"no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any","Output":"approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour."}
{"Input":"which I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed","Output":"to announce a different sort of man.\""}
{"Input":"with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,","Output":"quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville"}
{"Input":"of the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,","Output":"during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects"}
{"Input":"to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this","Output":"the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not"}
{"Input":"however.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,","Output":"it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence"}
{"Input":"of their conversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;","Output":"it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their"}
{"Input":"\"In all these cases, there are established usages which","Output":"make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant."}
{"Input":"She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,","Output":"to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot"}
{"Input":"in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of","Output":"tasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,"}
{"Input":"There must be the same immediate association of thought,","Output":"though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain."}
{"Input":"Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;","Output":"but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,"}
{"Input":"but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;","Output":"and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in"}
{"Input":"upon Colonel Wallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed","Output":"to escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting"}
{"Input":"to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,","Output":"placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her"}
{"Input":"but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!","Output":"the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all"}
{"Input":"suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,","Output":"of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look"}
{"Input":"with sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.","Output":"\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior"}
{"Input":"of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home","Output":"at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid"}
{"Input":"the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,","Output":"substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,"}
{"Input":"felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.","Output":"In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit"}
{"Input":"immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.","Output":"Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking."}
{"Input":"described by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted","Output":"with you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,"}
{"Input":"civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.","Output":"She was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which"}
{"Input":"\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville","Output":"was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention"}
{"Input":"I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\"","Output":"Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely"}
{"Input":"to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath","Output":"who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has"}
{"Input":"Having alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.","Output":"When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,"}
{"Input":"than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.","Output":"\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!"}
{"Input":"as good company, as those who would collect good company around them,","Output":"they had their value.  Anne smiled and said,"}
{"Input":"in every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses","Output":"to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,"}
{"Input":"I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"","Output":"Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,"}
{"Input":"to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could","Output":"get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being"}
{"Input":"and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of","Output":"their deception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure,"}
{"Input":"he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;","Output":"and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife"}
{"Input":"It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.","Output":"Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,"}
{"Input":"I was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,","Output":"and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\""}
{"Input":"and at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,","Output":"and made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;"}
{"Input":"she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory","Output":"and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either."}
{"Input":"But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands","Output":"that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible"}
{"Input":"her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself.","Output":"But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;"}
{"Input":"moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.","Output":"Here was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman"}
{"Input":"running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.","Output":"Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have"}
{"Input":"had at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,","Output":"and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually"}
{"Input":"and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about","Output":"near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant."}
{"Input":"and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might","Output":"convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements"}
{"Input":"the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,","Output":"without reference to the actual results of their case, which,"}
{"Input":"in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open","Output":"to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements"}
{"Input":"that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.","Output":"How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted"}
{"Input":"he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.","Output":"He truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family"}
{"Input":"and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,","Output":"without the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder"}
{"Input":"withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all","Output":"the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,"}
{"Input":"to see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,","Output":"and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection"}
{"Input":"As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's party","Output":"began talking of them."}
{"Input":"at my time of life!\"","Output":"Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,"}
{"Input":"clear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix","Output":"on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would"}
{"Input":"and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering","Output":"her husband's property in the West Indies, by writing for her,"}
{"Input":"and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner,","Output":"he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,"}
{"Input":"A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness","Output":"on Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon"}
{"Input":"but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,","Output":"seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort."}
{"Input":"Mary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked","Output":"to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,"}
{"Input":"fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think","Output":"I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say"}
{"Input":"and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant","Output":"with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite"}
{"Input":"It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;","Output":"Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,"}
{"Input":"after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,","Output":"\"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are"}
{"Input":"I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.","Output":"What is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,"}
{"Input":"before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,","Output":"and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death."}
{"Input":"effect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician","Output":"is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even"}
{"Input":"tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,","Output":"and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,"}
{"Input":"\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.","Output":"I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell and Mrs Smith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed","Output":"to attach himself.  Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,"}
{"Input":"a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had","Output":"disclosed all, too late?"}
{"Input":"and riding out the heaviest weather.\"","Output":"\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit"}
{"Input":"listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,","Output":"one quick, conscious look at her."}
{"Input":"for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen","Output":"very little.\""}
{"Input":"in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.","Output":"An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective"}
{"Input":"I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted","Output":"with Mr Elliot's real character.  Though I fully believe that,"}
{"Input":"to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;","Output":"and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,"}
{"Input":"of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?","Output":"She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;"}
{"Input":"the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,","Output":"and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter."}
{"Input":"It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be","Output":"a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\""}
{"Input":"to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.","Output":"The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts"}
{"Input":"And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"","Output":"Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave."}
{"Input":"\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;","Output":"stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of"}
{"Input":"your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.","Output":"By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\""}
{"Input":"\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.","Output":"Anne is too delicate for them.\""}
{"Input":"There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances","Output":"of particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that"}
{"Input":"make my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,","Output":"and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants."}
{"Input":"on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week","Output":"or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going"}
{"Input":"He did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him","Output":"at a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval"}
{"Input":"and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.","Output":"The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of"}
{"Input":"\"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne,","Output":"\"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\""}
{"Input":"She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,","Output":"but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--"}
{"Input":"though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible","Output":"that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her"}
{"Input":"was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,","Output":"on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself"}
{"Input":"with the decencies even of a private gentleman!  No, he would sooner","Output":"quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\""}
{"Input":"very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary","Output":"was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,"}
{"Input":"had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still","Output":"near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,"}
{"Input":"of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves","Output":"seemed to be staring in astonishment."}
{"Input":"giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.","Output":"Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age"}
{"Input":"outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.","Output":"It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she"}
{"Input":"Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--","Output":"\"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood."}
{"Input":"very affectionately of the other.\"","Output":"\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes"}
{"Input":"closed her heart or ruined her spirits.","Output":"In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,"}
{"Input":"no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.","Output":"I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before."}
{"Input":"and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;","Output":"and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,"}
{"Input":"and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.","Output":"In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever"}

{"Input":"from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore","Output":"lost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,"}
{"Input":"and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,","Output":"in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost"}
{"Input":"of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed","Output":"there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,"}

{"Input":"\"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have","Output":"admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact"}
{"Input":"There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,","Output":"at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection."}
{"Input":"in the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door","Output":"opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was"}

{"Input":"Mrs Smith said nothing.","Output":"\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having"}

{"Input":"For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,","Output":"which he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had succeeded,"}
{"Input":"Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!","Output":"And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;"}

{"Input":"I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,","Output":"which may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,"}
{"Input":"as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied","Output":"without his running on to give notice."}
{"Input":"These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers","Output":"were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,"}
{"Input":"only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty","Output":"of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without"}
{"Input":"perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of","Output":"a little interval for recollection.\""}

{"Input":"let him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed","Output":"her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet","Output":"\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak"}
{"Input":"of all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females","Output":"of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted"}
{"Input":"An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective","Output":"of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went"}

{"Input":"We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her","Output":"marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;"}
{"Input":"Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.","Output":"It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be"}
{"Input":"That she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,","Output":"you have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts"}
{"Input":"\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced","Output":"to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges"}
{"Input":"so many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,","Output":"though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth"}
{"Input":"to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.","Output":"She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,"}
{"Input":"Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was","Output":"quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him."}
{"Input":"we women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,","Output":"that every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?"}
{"Input":"at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,","Output":"the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk"}
{"Input":"in her father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,","Output":"stood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some"}
{"Input":"in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"","Output":"\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;"}
{"Input":"of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight","Output":"of Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute"}
{"Input":"for she saw nothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine","Output":"a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she"}
{"Input":"In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;","Output":"the sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement"}
{"Input":"Anne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,","Output":"and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been"}
{"Input":"They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them","Output":"this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,"}
{"Input":"of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here","Output":"for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,"}
{"Input":"\"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.","Output":"If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,"}
{"Input":"of such a case was against Mr Elliot.","Output":"Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied"}

{"Input":"exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year","Output":"of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth's brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot's company,","Output":"but she had not courage to ask the question."}
{"Input":"and amused also that the course of events and the new interests","Output":"of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour"}
{"Input":"Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.","Output":"They had met.  They had been once more in the same room."}
{"Input":"though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth","Output":"of the party in general."}
{"Input":"but I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.","Output":"I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice."}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate","Output":"brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes"}
{"Input":"would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,","Output":"have renewed the engagement then?\""}
{"Input":"but no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with","Output":"a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise"}
{"Input":"and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,","Output":"he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs"}
{"Input":"The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,","Output":"only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort."}
{"Input":"would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,","Output":"as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted"}
{"Input":"The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might","Output":"compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity,"}
{"Input":"The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of","Output":"much extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;"}
{"Input":"Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:","Output":"but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,"}
{"Input":"they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.","Output":"Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures"}
{"Input":"but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had","Output":"accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;"}
{"Input":"and calculations.  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence","Output":"pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,"}

{"Input":"of the gentleman who is just gone away?\"","Output":"\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night"}
{"Input":"But Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,","Output":"for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you"}

{"Input":"counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning","Output":"to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,"}
{"Input":"before she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and","Output":"acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness"}
{"Input":"between the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was","Output":"most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also"}
{"Input":"my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,","Output":"which I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed"}
{"Input":"to have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself","Output":"at all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,"}
{"Input":"\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.","Output":"He is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him a book, and he will"}

{"Input":"not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited","Output":"as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching","Output":"to imprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light."}
{"Input":"Anne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application","Output":"to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same"}

{"Input":"a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.","Output":"With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,"}
{"Input":"and was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,","Output":"and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid"}

{"Input":"but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper","Output":"with his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,"}
{"Input":"of such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary","Output":"to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning"}
{"Input":"and Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,","Output":"and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,"}
{"Input":"A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last,","Output":"had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled"}

{"Input":"all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,","Output":"that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,"}
{"Input":"Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--","Output":"\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had"}
{"Input":"never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,","Output":"too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found"}
{"Input":"Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious","Output":"and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,"}
{"Input":"She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,","Output":"but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,"}
{"Input":"From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been","Output":"a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong"}
{"Input":"for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you","Output":"would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,","Output":"when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again."}

{"Input":"but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;","Output":"and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than"}
{"Input":"and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.","Output":"I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself."}
{"Input":"She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,","Output":"she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,"}
{"Input":"In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,","Output":"she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned"}
{"Input":"Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed","Output":"the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,"}

{"Input":"to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,","Output":"and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive"}
{"Input":"the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,","Output":"or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend"}
{"Input":"perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed","Output":"of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more"}
{"Input":"but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.","Output":"Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,"}

{"Input":"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"","Output":"Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain."}
{"Input":"Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification","Output":"of finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect"}
{"Input":"Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived","Output":"excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,"}
{"Input":"and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,","Output":"she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released"}
{"Input":"in his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,","Output":"which I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know"}
{"Input":"How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always","Output":"incomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now."}
{"Input":"of her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly","Output":"comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's mind,"}
{"Input":"to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant","Output":"than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,","Output":"stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;"}

{"Input":"Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care","Output":"of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary."}
{"Input":"in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,","Output":"and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! he talks of you,\" cried Charles, \"in such terms--\"","Output":"Mary interrupted him. \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him"}
{"Input":"Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even","Output":"these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have"}
{"Input":"very much about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,","Output":"you know, are always worse than anybody's.\""}
{"Input":"I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.","Output":"Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him."}
{"Input":"I think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner","Output":"of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?"}

{"Input":"since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had","Output":"not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours"}

{"Input":"and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,","Output":"and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her."}
{"Input":"were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful","Output":"confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which"}
{"Input":"Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,","Output":"the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others."}
{"Input":"he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered","Output":"that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,"}
{"Input":"suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you","Output":"at the time.\""}
{"Input":"and yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid's room,","Output":"or swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not"}

{"Input":"their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly","Output":"the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages"}
{"Input":"most interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them","Output":"of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,"}
{"Input":"Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration","Output":"towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:"}
{"Input":"Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and","Output":"more particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure"}

{"Input":"but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"","Output":"While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?"}
{"Input":"influenced her fate.","Output":"The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible"}
{"Input":"How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more","Output":"than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each"}
{"Input":"that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal","Output":"to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae"}
{"Input":"I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say","Output":"upon woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk"}
{"Input":"for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,","Output":"that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,"}

{"Input":"and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell","Output":"should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require"}
{"Input":"dear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;","Output":"I have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?"}
{"Input":"all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.","Output":"\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;"}
{"Input":"What is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,","Output":"who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and"}

{"Input":"and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful","Output":"civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations."}
{"Input":"I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to","Output":"Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense"}
{"Input":"of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her","Output":"if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself"}
{"Input":"It was spoken with enthusiasm.","Output":"\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\""}
{"Input":"a great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had","Output":"looked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;"}

{"Input":"The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation","Output":"returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,"}
{"Input":"indeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta","Output":"would not dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!"}
{"Input":"she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman","Output":"has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient"}

{"Input":"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.","Output":"A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,"}
{"Input":"and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;","Output":"a wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple"}
{"Input":"which her friend meant to create.","Output":"Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot."}
{"Input":"and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you","Output":"in the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\""}
{"Input":"a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,","Output":"but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,","Output":"and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,"}
{"Input":"of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.","Output":"In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;"}

{"Input":"to shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,","Output":"though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed"}

{"Input":"There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this speech,","Output":"a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,"}
{"Input":"like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.","Output":"What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,"}
{"Input":"His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;","Output":"since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character"}

{"Input":"\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.","Output":"\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know"}
{"Input":"I am very angry with you.\"","Output":"\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?"}
{"Input":"for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.","Output":"I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous"}
{"Input":"She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,","Output":"where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,"}
{"Input":"her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--","Output":"she was only Anne."}
{"Input":"She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth","Output":"believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman"}

{"Input":"to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies","Output":"of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors"}
{"Input":"after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him","Output":"in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,"}
{"Input":"her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,","Output":"had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into"}
{"Input":"He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;","Output":"and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring"}
{"Input":"that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;","Output":"that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time"}
{"Input":"Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,","Output":"he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,"}
{"Input":"\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was","Output":"so attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,"}
{"Input":"Mary knows it is.\"","Output":"But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from"}
{"Input":"recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all","Output":"very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary"}
{"Input":"neither was there anything among the other component parts","Output":"of the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms"}
{"Input":"of its being very ungenteel to be curious.","Output":"\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,"}
{"Input":"to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;","Output":"and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,"}
{"Input":"but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept","Output":"the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,"}
{"Input":"From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal,","Output":"and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;"}
{"Input":"and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it","Output":"(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing."}
{"Input":"of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,","Output":"everything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,"}
{"Input":"Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;","Output":"former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;"}
{"Input":"he did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,","Output":"to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again."}
{"Input":"his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him","Output":"that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house"}
{"Input":"of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I","Output":"leave you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,"}
{"Input":"Have not I done well, mother?\"","Output":"Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness"}
{"Input":"I am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature","Output":"the whole morning!\""}
{"Input":"to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless","Output":"old cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen"}
{"Input":"of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,","Output":"patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices"}
{"Input":"and out of doors as long as they could.","Output":"Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all"}
{"Input":"the whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be","Output":"introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\""}
{"Input":"He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented","Output":"setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;"}
{"Input":"We asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook","Output":"to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,"}
{"Input":"of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.","Output":"Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,"}
{"Input":"of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims","Output":"on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,"}
{"Input":"as are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,","Output":"half hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings"}
{"Input":"beyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,","Output":"to \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding"}
{"Input":"he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions","Output":"respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance"}
{"Input":"But he was confident that he should soon be rich:","Output":"full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,"}
{"Input":"But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from","Output":"not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation"}
{"Input":"than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity","Output":"he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated"}
{"Input":"and saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while","Output":"hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,"}
{"Input":"a most decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;","Output":"and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books"}
{"Input":"in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,","Output":"excepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,"}
{"Input":"\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"","Output":"\"And--were you much acquainted?\""}
{"Input":"you need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"","Output":"Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt"}
{"Input":"you know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry","Output":"that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick"}
{"Input":"and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,","Output":"all day long.\""}
{"Input":"to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed","Output":"earlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes"}
{"Input":"he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,","Output":"and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,"}
{"Input":"An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these,","Output":"on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out"}
{"Input":"was embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,","Output":"or anything so certainly as embarrassed."}
{"Input":"and the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed","Output":"between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet"}
{"Input":"than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,","Output":"exerting himself, said--"}
{"Input":"to go about the house or not.\"","Output":"Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully."}
{"Input":"she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List","Output":"(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),"}
{"Input":"or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.","Output":"\"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\""}
{"Input":"in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits","Output":"of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy."}
{"Input":"fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;","Output":"and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications"}
{"Input":"was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,","Output":"than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy"}
{"Input":"The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way","Output":"which she had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen"}
{"Input":"but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop","Output":"comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,"}
{"Input":"easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance","Output":"than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself"}
{"Input":"she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.","Output":"The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:"}
{"Input":"It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had","Output":"provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,"}
{"Input":"\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced","Output":"to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;"}
{"Input":"when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.","Output":"I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of"}
{"Input":"had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application","Output":"for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards"}
{"Input":"she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.","Output":"Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long"}
{"Input":"Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,","Output":"and not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out."}
{"Input":"the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this","Output":"side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest"}
{"Input":"for the parlour door was open.","Output":"\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of","Output":"Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side."}
{"Input":"a devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"","Output":"Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,"}
{"Input":"Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from","Output":"an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,"}
{"Input":"at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life","Output":"as I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure."}
{"Input":"supposed capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--","Output":"\"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm."}
{"Input":"that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;","Output":"and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently"}
{"Input":"\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means","Output":"as are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,"}
{"Input":"Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;","Output":"and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over."}
{"Input":"for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.","Output":"The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\""}
{"Input":"which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning","Output":"young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings"}
{"Input":"in consequence.","Output":"A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;"}
{"Input":"\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,","Output":"will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing"}
{"Input":"did; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\"","Output":"\"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies"}
{"Input":"And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does","Output":"see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence,"}
{"Input":"of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features","Output":"and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell"}
{"Input":"but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,","Output":"her mind was in confusion."}
{"Input":"Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise","Output":"of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home"}
{"Input":"everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,","Output":"it had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had"}
{"Input":"but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her","Output":"on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much"}
{"Input":"I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"","Output":"\"You have had your little boys with you?\""}
{"Input":"She only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?","Output":"The others will be here presently.\""}
{"Input":"but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;","Output":"and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her"}
{"Input":"of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;","Output":"and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want"}
{"Input":"did not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;","Output":"but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,"}
{"Input":"to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her","Output":"for directions."}
{"Input":"to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling","Output":"but gratitude apparent."}
{"Input":"(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.","Output":"Well,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere"}
{"Input":"respected and loved.","Output":"They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme"}
{"Input":"of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea","Output":"of the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that"}
{"Input":"She had rather play.  She is never tired of playing.\"  Once, too,","Output":"he spoke to her.  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over,"}
{"Input":"Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that","Output":"she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable"}
{"Input":"and the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.","Output":"Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--"}
{"Input":"or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,","Output":"as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question."}
{"Input":"to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances","Output":"of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure"}
{"Input":"came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something","Output":"must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference"}
{"Input":"her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together","Output":"most happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value."}
{"Input":"break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was","Output":"as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become"}
{"Input":"We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,","Output":"Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,"}
{"Input":"respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance","Output":"of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,","Output":"a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;"}
{"Input":"but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed","Output":"far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced"}
{"Input":"of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;","Output":"but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters."}
{"Input":"he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,","Output":"you know, without its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry"}
{"Input":"for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening","Output":"in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse."}
{"Input":"suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,","Output":"because I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now,"}
{"Input":"or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,","Output":"nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\""}
{"Input":"\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game","Output":"to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found"}
{"Input":"the next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly","Output":"ought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\""}
{"Input":"\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;","Output":"\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me"}
{"Input":"when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's","Output":"at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch."}
{"Input":"and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental","Output":"to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;"}
{"Input":"near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.","Output":"Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,"}
{"Input":"she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little","Output":"to the faults of those who possessed them.  Herself the widow of"}
{"Input":"had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on","Output":"till she overtook her."}
{"Input":"very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,","Output":"cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?"}
{"Input":"They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme","Output":"answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being"}
{"Input":"Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,","Output":"sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot."}
{"Input":"But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility","Output":"of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,"}
{"Input":"to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain","Output":"with him.\""}
{"Input":"in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.","Output":"They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being"}
{"Input":"The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries","Output":"recovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully."}
{"Input":"you do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,","Output":"indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly."}
{"Input":"(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,","Output":"I suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably."}
{"Input":"they had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta's","Output":"coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,"}
{"Input":"it is very fit she should have him.\"","Output":"\"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing"}
{"Input":"so crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;","Output":"and Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into"}
{"Input":"to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.","Output":"The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,"}
{"Input":"and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--","Output":"\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you."}
{"Input":"The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,","Output":"and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--"}
{"Input":"he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"","Output":"\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck"}
{"Input":"offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,","Output":"addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to"}
{"Input":"on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing","Output":"to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with"}
{"Input":"Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.","Output":"The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it"}
{"Input":"for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection","Output":"which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence"}
{"Input":"for whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"","Output":"was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible"}
{"Input":"We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.","Output":"There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,"}
{"Input":"but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.","Output":"He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,"}

{"Input":"by anybody else.\"","Output":"It was spoken with enthusiasm."}
{"Input":"Yes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had","Output":"placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it,"}
{"Input":"might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,","Output":"and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\""}
{"Input":"lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,","Output":"whose landed property and general importance were second in that country,"}
{"Input":"\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above","Output":"half a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses"}
{"Input":"which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind wishes,","Output":"as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;"}
{"Input":"a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.","Output":"She was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,"}
{"Input":"into another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\"","Output":"But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her."}
{"Input":"was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction","Output":"of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,"}
{"Input":"So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little","Output":"additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just"}
{"Input":"though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.","Output":"Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;"}
{"Input":"on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness","Output":"of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased"}
{"Input":"sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts","Output":"and their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that"}

{"Input":"When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,","Output":"and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,"}
{"Input":"Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was","Output":"come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;"}

{"Input":"he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.","Output":"Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were"}

{"Input":"to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,","Output":"was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,"}
{"Input":"to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near","Output":"giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\""}
{"Input":"and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,","Output":"which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance"}

{"Input":"Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.","Output":"No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been"}

{"Input":"\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects","Output":"I think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\""}
{"Input":"all the rest had been mere applications for money.","Output":"In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,"}
{"Input":"little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection","Output":"she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,"}
{"Input":"but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend","Output":"to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\""}
{"Input":"After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--","Output":"\"In all these cases, there are established usages which"}
{"Input":"and best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,","Output":"in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;"}
{"Input":"every twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,","Output":"and his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense"}
{"Input":"for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the","Output":"elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting"}
{"Input":"sit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"","Output":"Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,"}
{"Input":"that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,","Output":"and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,"}
{"Input":"and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.","Output":"\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,"}
{"Input":"and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her","Output":"was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,"}
{"Input":"in the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,","Output":"and at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,"}
{"Input":"and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father","Output":"and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought"}
{"Input":"or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different","Output":"at the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed"}
{"Input":"When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.","Output":"The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,"}
{"Input":"She was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;","Output":"and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs"}
{"Input":"the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,","Output":"who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder","Output":"for an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;"}
{"Input":"in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath","Output":"for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,"}
{"Input":"gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.","Output":"I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me"}
{"Input":"and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour","Output":"was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of"}
{"Input":"before our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,","Output":"became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained"}

{"Input":"and wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  And yet,","Output":"a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company"}
{"Input":"house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised","Output":"if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;"}
{"Input":"and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after","Output":"Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country."}
{"Input":"so attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,","Output":"when they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not"}
{"Input":"You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,","Output":"as you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had"}

{"Input":"It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other","Output":"Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson."}
{"Input":"`Lady Wentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing,","Output":"indeed, for Henrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta"}
{"Input":"and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been","Output":"near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain"}
{"Input":"too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,","Output":"\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences"}
{"Input":"\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken","Output":"to procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride"}
{"Input":"and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.","Output":"\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him."}
{"Input":"A'n't I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.","Output":"It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will"}
{"Input":"have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion","Output":"with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen"}

{"Input":"took up the subject again, to say--","Output":"\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,"}
{"Input":"\"Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,","Output":"but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known"}
{"Input":"and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring","Output":"for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,"}
{"Input":"his friend Colonel Wallis.\"","Output":"\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\""}
{"Input":"There is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"","Output":"Anne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea"}
{"Input":"before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been","Output":"total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back"}
{"Input":"\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married","Output":"people begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,"}
{"Input":"as I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person","Output":"who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions."}
{"Input":"Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender","Output":"of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income"}
{"Input":"might yet be made observant by it.","Output":"The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,"}
{"Input":"self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress","Output":"that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  In person, she was"}
{"Input":"any friend of mine belonging to it.\"","Output":"\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise."}
{"Input":"not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to","Output":"like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren."}
{"Input":"She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating","Output":"her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,"}
{"Input":"a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,","Output":"to his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot"}
{"Input":"the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages","Output":"over all the others which they had either seen or heard of,"}
{"Input":"and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross","Output":"they drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;"}
{"Input":"in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes","Output":"brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there"}
{"Input":"which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.","Output":"The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room"}
{"Input":"and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,","Output":"as it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing."}
{"Input":"I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?","Output":"and it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother's feelings,"}
{"Input":"Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter","Output":"with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,"}
{"Input":"Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired","Output":"a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,"}

{"Input":"be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken","Output":"ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?\""}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,","Output":"and he was to join them on the Cobb."}
{"Input":"or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.","Output":"From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper"}
{"Input":"and consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed","Output":"in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme."}
{"Input":"any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell","Output":"must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,"}
{"Input":"but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication","Output":"could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,"}
{"Input":"pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,","Output":"and which supply me with the means of doing a little good"}
{"Input":"not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end","Output":"to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up"}
{"Input":"of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"","Output":"\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be"}
{"Input":"daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of","Output":"Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,"}
{"Input":"from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope","Output":"of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be"}
{"Input":"\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say","Output":"you know him by name.\""}
{"Input":"and when the horses were baited, he was off.","Output":"(End of volume one.)"}
{"Input":"He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot","Output":"as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited"}
{"Input":"Now nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party","Output":"now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it"}
{"Input":"She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything","Output":"akin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure"}
{"Input":"\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?","Output":"Do not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to"}
{"Input":"I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from","Output":"my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,"}
{"Input":"till to-morrow.\"","Output":"As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,"}
{"Input":"though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed","Output":"to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being"}
{"Input":"certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.","Output":"She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,"}
{"Input":"about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent","Output":"you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that"}
{"Input":"He must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished","Output":"ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;"}
{"Input":"when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.","Output":"\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,"}
{"Input":"for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;","Output":"and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,"}
{"Input":"and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent","Output":"on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing"}
{"Input":"to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;","Output":"and who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names"}
{"Input":"(pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,","Output":"if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent"}
{"Input":"relative to the marriage, which made a material difference","Output":"in the discredit of it."}
{"Input":"Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.","Output":"Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough"}
{"Input":"so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,","Output":"that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,","Output":"with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\""}
{"Input":"where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,","Output":"when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment"}
{"Input":"to procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride","Output":"than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be"}
{"Input":"that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:","Output":"and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,"}
{"Input":"a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.","Output":"When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,"}
{"Input":"and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from","Output":"lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle."}
{"Input":"so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house","Output":"at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;"}
{"Input":"half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,","Output":"seemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends"}
{"Input":"they last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return","Output":"the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean"}
{"Input":"and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother","Output":"among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest."}
{"Input":"She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;","Output":"but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly"}
{"Input":"The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,","Output":"but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;"}
{"Input":"good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance","Output":"of a very different description."}
{"Input":"and their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that","Output":"perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three"}
{"Input":"that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,","Output":"I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?"}
{"Input":"but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.","Output":"A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,"}
{"Input":"seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,","Output":"flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in"}

{"Input":"to be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.","Output":"She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak."}
{"Input":"but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire","Output":"in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,"}
{"Input":"the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;","Output":"but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson"}
{"Input":"with respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed","Output":"to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,"}
{"Input":"or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,","Output":"youth-killing dependence!  It must not be, if by any fair interference"}
{"Input":"Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,","Output":"\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,"}
{"Input":"to keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk","Output":"must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of"}
{"Input":"the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,","Output":"very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter"}
{"Input":"seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,","Output":"by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet."}
{"Input":"knowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?","Output":"Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,'"}
{"Input":"you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert","Output":"of last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\""}
{"Input":"Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.","Output":"I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\""}
{"Input":"and more cool, than she had been the night before.","Output":"He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where"}
{"Input":"Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.","Output":"She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked"}
{"Input":"to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.","Output":"She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those"}
{"Input":"as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,","Output":"but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;"}
{"Input":"merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.","Output":"Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only"}
{"Input":"the most friendly terms when I arrived.\"","Output":"\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\""}
{"Input":"Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority.","Output":"In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove"}
{"Input":"to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,","Output":"to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her"}
{"Input":"of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,","Output":"solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)"}
{"Input":"and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.","Output":"Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for"}
{"Input":"incomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.","Output":"Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better"}
{"Input":"that his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.","Output":"Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,"}
{"Input":"almost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think","Output":"that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when"}
{"Input":"they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.","Output":"Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes."}
{"Input":"visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest","Output":"in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath"}
{"Input":"I trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been","Output":"thinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,"}
{"Input":"whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,","Output":"on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists"}
{"Input":"could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,","Output":"in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess."}
{"Input":"which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;","Output":"from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying"}
{"Input":"\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"","Output":"\"A surgeon!\" said Anne."}
{"Input":"esteemed about equal.","Output":"The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;","Output":"caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,"}
{"Input":"opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance","Output":"among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,"}
{"Input":"It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything","Output":"tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced."}
{"Input":"of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object","Output":"of her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,"}
{"Input":"they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be","Output":"all their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:"}
{"Input":"I have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should","Output":"like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight"}

{"Input":"to be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\"","Output":"No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where"}
{"Input":"I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me","Output":"other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible"}
{"Input":"might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to","Output":"the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have"}

{"Input":"be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.","Output":"The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance"}
{"Input":"and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,","Output":"delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman"}
{"Input":"that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her","Output":"with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,"}
{"Input":"provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,","Output":"with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and"}
{"Input":"They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.","Output":"\"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter.  \"The Crofts have arrived in Bath?"}
{"Input":"to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,","Output":"in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,"}
{"Input":"Anne could not draw upon Charles's brain for a regular history","Output":"of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints"}
{"Input":"would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem","Output":"a little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\""}
{"Input":"\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense","Output":"and pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much"}
{"Input":"decided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;","Output":"all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there."}
{"Input":"it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature","Output":"of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon."}
{"Input":"He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,","Output":"clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;"}
{"Input":"with him.\"","Output":"\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!"}
{"Input":"in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.","Output":"So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little"}
{"Input":"the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"","Output":"Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion"}
{"Input":"and it required a long application of solitude and reflection","Output":"to recover her."}
{"Input":"passed as a duty.\"","Output":"\"But was not she a very low woman?\""}
{"Input":"There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as","Output":"opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;"}
{"Input":"\"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"","Output":"(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and"}
{"Input":"see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?","Output":"She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove"}
{"Input":"he thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,","Output":"her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been"}
{"Input":"Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.","Output":"With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,"}
{"Input":"and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,","Output":"and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,"}
{"Input":"and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"","Output":"Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of"}
{"Input":"He told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.","Output":"It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,"}
{"Input":"among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,","Output":"and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away."}
{"Input":"\"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd","Output":"one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,"}
{"Input":"fairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening","Output":"did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together"}
{"Input":"supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was","Output":"but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings."}
{"Input":"Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her","Output":"was indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such"}
{"Input":"the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,","Output":"after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,"}
{"Input":"was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk","Output":"and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,"}
{"Input":"Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.","Output":"\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which"}
{"Input":"how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part","Output":"of her own life."}
{"Input":"The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,","Output":"their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females"}
{"Input":"with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were","Output":"obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay"}
{"Input":"eight years may be little more than nothing.","Output":"Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like"}
{"Input":"produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,","Output":"as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night","Output":"from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were"}
{"Input":"with a gentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps,","Output":"may be walking here.\""}
{"Input":"in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville","Output":"would but think so.\""}
{"Input":"should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,","Output":"under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return"}
{"Input":"on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,","Output":"now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life"}
{"Input":"but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,","Output":"though there were on each side continual subjects of offence,"}
{"Input":"were most likely to attract him.","Output":"Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from"}
{"Input":"dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,","Output":"first, from the circumstance of her having been three years"}
{"Input":"and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.","Output":"Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!"}
{"Input":"well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,","Output":"needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably"}
{"Input":"and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing","Output":"to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart"}
{"Input":"that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you,","Output":"whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter"}
{"Input":"of the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,","Output":"that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,"}
{"Input":"and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was","Output":"made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it."}
{"Input":"That was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on","Output":"the most friendly terms when I arrived.\""}
{"Input":"to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:","Output":"I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness"}
{"Input":"\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed","Output":"in making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have"}
{"Input":"are gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart","Output":"even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years"}
{"Input":"quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville","Output":"had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received"}
{"Input":"to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,","Output":"where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;"}
{"Input":"yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees","Output":"came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something"}
{"Input":"shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,","Output":"and safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be"}
{"Input":"high enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\"","Output":"would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;"}
{"Input":"for her own.","Output":"The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company."}
{"Input":"improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked","Output":"for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down"}
{"Input":"and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that","Output":"she should like to know who he was."}
{"Input":"by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.","Output":"If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;"}
{"Input":"Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught","Output":"the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing"}
{"Input":"of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,","Output":"(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),"}
{"Input":"the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea","Output":"of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\""}
{"Input":"comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's mind,","Output":"the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment"}
{"Input":"an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,","Output":"consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,"}
{"Input":"was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,","Output":"when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,"}
{"Input":"in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.","Output":"The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,","Output":"says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\""}
{"Input":"\"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!\" whispered Mary","Output":"very audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!"}
{"Input":"never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety","Output":"which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man"}
{"Input":"This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else","Output":"could have done."}
{"Input":"which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,","Output":"had been followed by a little history of his private life,"}
{"Input":"quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,","Output":"burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character"}
{"Input":"close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,","Output":"Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of"}
{"Input":"Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could","Output":"never become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement."}
{"Input":"with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward","Output":"to meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot"}
{"Input":"by the sisters from the Mansion-house.","Output":"It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came"}
{"Input":"a remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape","Output":"all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool"}
{"Input":"eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--","Output":"\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?"}
{"Input":"Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where","Output":"the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,"}
{"Input":"He persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.","Output":"He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed"}
{"Input":"and especially the history of her own family, must ever present","Output":"the remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter"}
{"Input":"very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend","Output":"Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings."}
{"Input":"as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,","Output":"but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility"}
{"Input":"the value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;","Output":"and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\""}
{"Input":"\"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has","Output":"too much spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better,"}
{"Input":"and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top","Output":"of the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;"}
{"Input":"of your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"","Output":"\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be"}
{"Input":"sweet flower gardens being neglected.\"","Output":"\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced"}
{"Input":"that it would now spread farther.","Output":"\"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late"}
{"Input":"could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects","Output":"were principally such as were wont to be always interesting:"}
{"Input":"for a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,","Output":"in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm"}
{"Input":"He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--","Output":"\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,"}
{"Input":"a second spring of youth and beauty.","Output":"When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change."}
{"Input":"It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;","Output":"a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\""}
{"Input":"was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of","Output":"and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came."}
{"Input":"They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills","Output":"and the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by"}
{"Input":"deep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,","Output":"for he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already"}
{"Input":"There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house","Output":"in the country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter."}

{"Input":"when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and","Output":"strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist"}
{"Input":"and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,","Output":"need not involve any particular awkwardness."}
{"Input":"following their own pursuits, and living on their own property,","Output":"without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,"}
{"Input":"to any one.\"","Output":"\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly,"}

{"Input":"of happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,","Output":"delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,"}
{"Input":"A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.","Output":"Troubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually"}
{"Input":"and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,","Output":"in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have"}
{"Input":"and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.","Output":"\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,"}
{"Input":"and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object","Output":"nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than"}

{"Input":"only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"","Output":"She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks"}
{"Input":"giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"","Output":"\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\""}
{"Input":"We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,","Output":"which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for"}
{"Input":"for modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"","Output":"\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are"}
{"Input":"very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution","Output":"of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here"}
{"Input":"it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their","Output":"usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of"}
{"Input":"And there was silence between them for a little while.","Output":"Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes"}
{"Input":"They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,","Output":"and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known"}
{"Input":"and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,","Output":"after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,"}
{"Input":"thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him;","Output":"and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,"}
{"Input":"It was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?","Output":"I hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it"}
{"Input":"who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.","Output":"I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared."}
{"Input":"read all day long.\"","Output":"\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring"}
{"Input":"bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct","Output":"which were least excusable."}
{"Input":"very fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been","Output":"used to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her"}
{"Input":"and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them","Output":"set off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,"}
{"Input":"A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have","Output":"Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure"}
{"Input":"as being less happy than herself.","Output":"The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back"}
{"Input":"were more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father","Output":"had at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,"}
{"Input":"but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,","Output":"and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her."}
{"Input":"strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist","Output":"idle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is"}

{"Input":"and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance","Output":"improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked"}
{"Input":"which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose","Output":"under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,"}
{"Input":"a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"","Output":"\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully."}
{"Input":"Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported","Output":"by her father, had disappointed her."}
{"Input":"of indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding","Output":"Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire"}
{"Input":"for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,","Output":"and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily"}
{"Input":"\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:","Output":"he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered"}
{"Input":"by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,","Output":"when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's"}
{"Input":"At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself","Output":"to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch"}
{"Input":"Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning","Output":"to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy"}
{"Input":"With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,","Output":"Mr Elliot was ushered into the room."}

{"Input":"he had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter","Output":"depended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,"}
{"Input":"as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,","Output":"she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,"}
{"Input":"Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had","Output":"no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any"}
{"Input":"and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;","Output":"but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop"}

{"Input":"that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,","Output":"some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling."}
{"Input":"\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,","Output":"had one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker"}
{"Input":"with your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"","Output":"\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,"}
{"Input":"and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive","Output":"in his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,"}
{"Input":"and a project for going thither was the consequence.","Output":"The young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked"}
{"Input":"with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,","Output":"and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had"}
{"Input":"perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour","Output":"if she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously"}
{"Input":"as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of","Output":"the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's.  He had intended,"}
{"Input":"and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,","Output":"she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience"}
{"Input":"pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions","Output":"and of hopes."}
{"Input":"exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most","Output":"mischievous kind."}
{"Input":"for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment","Output":"of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;"}
{"Input":"at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,","Output":"turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,"}
{"Input":"she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,","Output":"almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,"}
{"Input":"young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings","Output":"it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature"}
{"Input":"the House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,","Output":"but apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,"}

{"Input":"themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions","Output":"in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again"}
{"Input":"there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements","Output":"of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration"}
{"Input":"a little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\"","Output":"(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)"}
{"Input":"the children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had","Output":"the smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\""}
{"Input":"How can you be so forgetful?\"","Output":"\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what's an evening party?"}
{"Input":"the two families had consented to the young people's wishes,","Output":"and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,"}
{"Input":"\"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that","Output":"every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors,"}
{"Input":"that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his","Output":"for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;"}
{"Input":"put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;","Output":"I could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,"}

{"Input":"of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours","Output":"which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,"}
{"Input":"if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.","Output":"Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children"}
{"Input":"two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;","Output":"the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,"}
{"Input":"\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make","Output":"a very long history, I think, of one such little article"}
{"Input":"and estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,","Output":"more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when"}
{"Input":"There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle","Output":"and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness"}
{"Input":"to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.","Output":"Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,"}
{"Input":"might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne","Output":"that the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must"}

{"Input":"She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe","Output":"that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement"}
{"Input":"and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself","Output":"neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive."}
{"Input":"now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it","Output":"most difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,"}
{"Input":"In the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?","Output":"my father's next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,"}
{"Input":"no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.","Output":"He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face"}
{"Input":"he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,","Output":"eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,"}
{"Input":"and fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,","Output":"he proceeded thus--"}
{"Input":"for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot","Output":"self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress"}

{"Input":"So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"","Output":"\"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,\""}
{"Input":"\"There we differ, Mary,\" said Anne.  \"I think Lady Russell would like him.","Output":"I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would"}
{"Input":"last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,","Output":"and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left"}
{"Input":"with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,","Output":"be continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe"}
{"Input":"she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.","Output":"Having alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole."}

{"Input":"hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,","Output":"but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;"}
{"Input":"it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been","Output":"a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him"}

{"Input":"invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting","Output":"to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,"}
{"Input":"a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;","Output":"and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,"}
{"Input":"and Henrietta directly.","Output":"Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present."}
{"Input":"I have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"","Output":"She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,"}
{"Input":"but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say","Output":"on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,"}
{"Input":"as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had","Output":"been gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,"}
{"Input":"could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.","Output":"Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;"}
{"Input":"for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming longer","Output":"for Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well as affections;"}
{"Input":"being all that she had time for, as she passed away.","Output":"As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's party"}

{"Input":"secured her two.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life;","Output":"and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering"}
{"Input":"however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her","Output":"when she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles"}
{"Input":"and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him;","Output":"and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her"}
{"Input":"on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources","Output":"of mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was"}
{"Input":"Well,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere","Output":"for you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?\""}
{"Input":"and voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself","Output":"at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,"}

{"Input":"and good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.","Output":"This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,"}
{"Input":"as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be","Output":"of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her"}
{"Input":"by that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself),","Output":"\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept"}
{"Input":"And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them","Output":"after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,"}

{"Input":"for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was","Output":"pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,"}
{"Input":"spoke of me to Mr Elliot?\"","Output":"\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,"}
{"Input":"Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;","Output":"which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments."}
{"Input":"the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,","Output":"made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her"}

{"Input":"most willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been","Output":"thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor"}

{"Input":"`Forty,' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves","Output":"my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin."}
{"Input":"To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;","Output":"and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her."}
{"Input":"appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,","Output":"was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away"}
{"Input":"of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,","Output":"you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding"}
{"Input":"Her own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,","Output":"before she could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was"}

{"Input":"As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them","Output":"no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,"}
{"Input":"she wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself","Output":"of another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight."}
{"Input":"said the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been","Output":"running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind."}
{"Input":"doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place","Output":"like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out"}
{"Input":"Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party","Output":"the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast."}
{"Input":"which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,","Output":"informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot."}
{"Input":"and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.","Output":"They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together."}
{"Input":"nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"","Output":"\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,"}
{"Input":"briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.","Output":"When this was told, his name distressed her no longer."}

{"Input":"what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind","Output":"which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved."}
{"Input":"now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart","Output":"or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks"}

{"Input":"that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth","Output":"whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back"}
{"Input":"It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;","Output":"always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view"}
{"Input":"or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.","Output":"She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,","Output":"as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was"}
{"Input":"\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?","Output":"Does he know that I am in Bath?\""}
{"Input":"perfectly recovered now?\"","Output":"He answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;"}
{"Input":"of quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,","Output":"particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being"}
{"Input":"more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly","Output":"paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,"}
{"Input":"He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,","Output":"sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word."}
{"Input":"to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House","Output":"at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,"}

{"Input":"and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board","Output":"without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,"}

{"Input":"now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life","Output":"when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,"}
{"Input":"for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,","Output":"French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch"}
{"Input":"the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.","Output":"After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field."}

{"Input":"if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,","Output":"proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;"}

{"Input":"and gently shook her head.","Output":"\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell,"}
{"Input":"to understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\"","Output":"from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!"}

{"Input":"I never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,","Output":"of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours."}
{"Input":"But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;","Output":"and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others"}

{"Input":"how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,","Output":"had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her."}
{"Input":"how those little fingers of yours fly about!\"","Output":"So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart"}
{"Input":"a little interval for recollection.\"","Output":"Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party"}
{"Input":"in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you","Output":"such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing"}
{"Input":"and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention","Output":"of quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,"}
{"Input":"This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,","Output":"\"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain"}
{"Input":"\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.","Output":"I am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,"}
{"Input":"to take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"","Output":"\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,"}
{"Input":"There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.","Output":"She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,"}
{"Input":"ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?\"","Output":"Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--"}
{"Input":"and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,","Output":"and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been"}
{"Input":"he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you","Output":"I shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which"}
{"Input":"she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared","Output":"from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had"}
{"Input":"We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who","Output":"has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to"}
{"Input":"the almost endless creations of the last century; and there,","Output":"if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history"}
{"Input":"her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,","Output":"open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages."}
{"Input":"I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"","Output":"There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this speech,"}
{"Input":"returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,","Output":"but not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had"}
{"Input":"on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,","Output":"and promised to procure and read them."}
{"Input":"This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time","Output":"at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather"}
{"Input":"Chapter 7","Output":"A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,"}
{"Input":"perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon","Output":"it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,"}
{"Input":"with emotion.","Output":"\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,"}
{"Input":"augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,","Output":"and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville"}
{"Input":"in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all","Output":"to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning"}
{"Input":"he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,","Output":"busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off."}
{"Input":"\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to","Output":"the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen"}
{"Input":"well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,","Output":"but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,"}
{"Input":"I fancy they are all at Uppercross.\"","Output":"This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,"}
{"Input":"and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,","Output":"her affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,"}
{"Input":"\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been","Output":"when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\""}
{"Input":"little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing","Output":"that I never go near.\""}
{"Input":"\"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.","Output":"Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?"}
{"Input":"always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view","Output":"of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,"}
{"Input":"by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,","Output":"more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family."}
{"Input":"and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.","Output":"Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest"}
{"Input":"and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne's;","Output":"and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left"}
{"Input":"but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour","Output":"at Uppercross.\""}
{"Input":"was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being","Output":"left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,"}
{"Input":"and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,","Output":"sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room."}
{"Input":"or the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after","Output":"her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--"}
{"Input":"\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.","Output":"It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof."}
{"Input":"\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"","Output":"\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well"}
{"Input":"very deficient both in justice and compassion.","Output":"She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired"}
{"Input":"going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings","Output":"and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,"}
{"Input":"He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been","Output":"lately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;"}
{"Input":"\"Can you really?\"","Output":"\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,"}
{"Input":"and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,","Output":"she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,"}
{"Input":"and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,","Output":"that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,"}
{"Input":"in such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands","Output":"of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,"}
{"Input":"\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith's reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.","Output":"I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet"}
{"Input":"a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,","Output":"with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,"}
{"Input":"of more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot","Output":"had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at"}
{"Input":"She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of","Output":"strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions"}
{"Input":"that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought","Output":"to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,"}
{"Input":"when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne","Output":"was inevitable."}
{"Input":"A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise","Output":"of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,"}
{"Input":"opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was","Output":"the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke."}
{"Input":"and in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.","Output":"In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,"}
{"Input":"So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart","Output":"must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;"}
{"Input":"I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\"","Output":"(pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,"}
{"Input":"when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,","Output":"grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,"}
{"Input":"a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.","Output":"Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready"}
{"Input":"\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me","Output":"such a good account of yourself on Thursday!\""}
{"Input":"But not a bit did Walter stir.","Output":"In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of"}
{"Input":"most difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,","Output":"perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached"}
{"Input":"was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible","Output":"with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward"}
{"Input":"that he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,","Output":"perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once"}
{"Input":"may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth","Output":"should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which"}
{"Input":"done otherwise.","Output":"To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;"}
{"Input":"of spending the morning in Rivers Street.","Output":"\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love."}
{"Input":"\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"","Output":"\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are."}
{"Input":"these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope","Output":"we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has"}
{"Input":"and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,","Output":"may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through","Output":"without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,"}
{"Input":"he could now value from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say","Output":"that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,"}
{"Input":"marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse","Output":"for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"to be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free","Output":"from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct"}
{"Input":"and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend","Output":"that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed."}
{"Input":"for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"","Output":"\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have asserted"}
{"Input":"that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,","Output":"he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;"}
{"Input":"to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"","Output":"\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme."}
{"Input":"What a very good-looking man!\"","Output":"\"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,"}
{"Input":"in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,","Output":"in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him"}
{"Input":"That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.","Output":"You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\""}
{"Input":"to those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?","Output":"Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove"}
{"Input":"naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,","Output":"that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you"}
{"Input":"not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined","Output":"at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason"}
{"Input":"in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;","Output":"but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom"}
{"Input":"Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"","Output":"Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles"}
{"Input":"but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.","Output":"It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,"}
{"Input":"and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,","Output":"who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest"}
{"Input":"long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye","Output":"upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then"}
{"Input":"Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were","Output":"in the other room.  `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was no end"}
{"Input":"of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,","Output":"and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,"}
{"Input":"to the Kellynch family?\"","Output":"\"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said"}
{"Input":"who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,","Output":"at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,"}
{"Input":"for four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,","Output":"his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,"}
{"Input":"He was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.","Output":"But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her."}
{"Input":"\"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything","Output":"to confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people"}
{"Input":"got away with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story","Output":"another time.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson."}
{"Input":"advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was","Output":"a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included."}
{"Input":"in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again","Output":"before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath."}
{"Input":"he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles","Output":"and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,"}
{"Input":"feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,","Output":"of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;"}
{"Input":"which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements","Output":"of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps."}
{"Input":"busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.","Output":"She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain."}
{"Input":"when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing","Output":"that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated,"}
{"Input":"a general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;","Output":"but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit."}
{"Input":"What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families","Output":"have done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;"}
{"Input":"who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.","Output":"She always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open,"}
{"Input":"which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,","Output":"and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,"}
{"Input":"from beginning to end.\"","Output":"Anne looked down to hide her smile."}
{"Input":"the second Sir Walter.\"","Output":"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;"}
{"Input":"of the pain he was occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph","Output":"in his manner.  He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of"}
{"Input":"After a moment's pause he said:  \"Though I came only yesterday,","Output":"I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\""}
{"Input":"at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;","Output":"and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross"}
{"Input":"Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth","Output":"was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;"}
{"Input":"But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.","Output":"How was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?"}
{"Input":"which conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,","Output":"his disposition lead him, to talk; and \"That was in the year six;\""}
{"Input":"greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,","Output":"he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature"}
{"Input":"I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know","Output":"nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare"}
{"Input":"and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel","Output":"that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness"}
{"Input":"\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.","Output":"\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,"}
{"Input":"but she would rather have caught his eye.","Output":"Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer"}
{"Input":"his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act","Output":"of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with"}
{"Input":"passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt","Output":"quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage,"}
{"Input":"A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She could say nothing.","Output":"\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,"}
{"Input":"but still she did it, and not with much happier effect;","Output":"though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication"}
{"Input":"\"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said","Output":"his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\""}
{"Input":"She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,","Output":"yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought"}
{"Input":"but now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference","Output":"to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;"}
{"Input":"could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.","Output":"Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,"}
{"Input":"\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior","Output":"I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,"}
{"Input":"the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"","Output":"\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living"}
{"Input":"a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards","Output":"quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against"}
{"Input":"and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street","Output":"on a commission of Mrs Clay's."}
{"Input":"he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not","Output":"recollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable"}
{"Input":"only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,","Output":"if people thought there was anything to complain of.\""}
{"Input":"She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,","Output":"and yet be happy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow"}
{"Input":"informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.","Output":"Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves"}
{"Input":"she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,","Output":"confident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others."}
{"Input":"she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy","Output":"in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last."}
{"Input":"That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely","Output":"well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,"}
{"Input":"that I can produce it.\"","Output":"This was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\""}
{"Input":"when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.","Output":"Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,"}
{"Input":"After another short silence--","Output":"\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?"}
{"Input":"in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.","Output":"Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,"}
{"Input":"Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,","Output":"and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror."}
{"Input":"an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.","Output":"She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged"}
{"Input":"speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,","Output":"to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,"}
{"Input":"in Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home","Output":"to ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else."}
{"Input":"for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,","Output":"she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory"}
{"Input":"may be conceived.","Output":"The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered"}
{"Input":"in her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,","Output":"and promise to stay."}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant","Output":"in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\""}
{"Input":"under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation","Output":"was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,"}
{"Input":"No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been","Output":"described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,"}
{"Input":"a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,","Output":"he might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly"}
{"Input":"His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour","Output":"of the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,"}
{"Input":"she was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison","Output":"of the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with--"}
{"Input":"between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,","Output":"admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner"}
{"Input":"but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and","Output":"Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.  They did not like each other,"}
{"Input":"of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased","Output":"to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be"}
{"Input":"We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;","Output":"and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it"}
{"Input":"I know what is due to my tenant.\"","Output":"Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how"}
{"Input":"and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,","Output":"to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process"}
{"Input":"to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was","Output":"little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,"}
{"Input":"softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,","Output":"but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes","Output":"spoke of me to Mr Elliot?\""}
{"Input":"\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,","Output":"but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with"}
{"Input":"only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested","Output":"and hospitable."}
{"Input":"and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be","Output":"struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments"}
{"Input":"how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable","Output":"she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!"}
{"Input":"She assured him that she had not.","Output":"\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he"}
{"Input":"in such a place as this.\"","Output":"\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft"}
{"Input":"however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent","Output":"of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged"}
{"Input":"with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably","Output":"in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea"}
{"Input":"careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think","Output":"very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,"}
{"Input":"and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.","Output":"Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live"}
{"Input":"\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them.","Output":"The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer walking.\""}
{"Input":"\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy","Output":"the evening parties of the place.\""}
{"Input":"but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,","Output":"some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could"}
{"Input":"you may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,","Output":"and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing;"}
{"Input":"\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths","Output":"open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed."}
{"Input":"and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome","Output":"drawing-rooms."}
{"Input":"most happily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.","Output":"Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming"}
{"Input":"under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game","Output":"he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself"}
{"Input":"first, from the circumstance of her having been three years","Output":"at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly,"}
{"Input":"in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"","Output":"Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught"}
{"Input":"ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"","Output":"At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose"}
{"Input":"and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view","Output":"of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded."}
{"Input":"which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still","Output":"be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known"}
{"Input":"that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,","Output":"before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off"}
{"Input":"not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard","Output":"among the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.","Output":"There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,"}
{"Input":"(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.","Output":"Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which"}
{"Input":"in the butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.","Output":"One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best."}
{"Input":"of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;","Output":"to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that"}
{"Input":"began with--","Output":"\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough","Output":"of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,"}
{"Input":"in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,","Output":"and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having"}
{"Input":"in only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority,","Output":"an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder"}
{"Input":"(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,","Output":"that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,"}
{"Input":"perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.","Output":"Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father"}
{"Input":"and today there could scarcely be an end.","Output":"She had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been"}
{"Input":"the high-priced things I have in hand now.\"","Output":"Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence"}
{"Input":"for help which he could not give.","Output":"Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,"}
{"Input":"\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has","Output":"just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat"}
{"Input":"the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added","Output":"the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,"}
{"Input":"that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when","Output":"Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was"}
{"Input":"was wise.","Output":"One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth"}
{"Input":"Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.","Output":"Her happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;"}
{"Input":"Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold","Output":"or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable"}
{"Input":"The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,","Output":"and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared"}
{"Input":"She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!","Output":"she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet."}
{"Input":"Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity","Output":"of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction"}
{"Input":"They were too much like joy, senseless joy!","Output":"She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,"}
{"Input":"and soon added in a different tone--","Output":"\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,"}

{"Input":"her look and manner declared, that go she would not.","Output":"After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,"}
{"Input":"to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,","Output":"she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play"}

{"Input":"She is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time","Output":"to hear her father say, \"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet,"}
{"Input":"from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her","Output":"before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville."}
{"Input":"from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from","Output":"doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,"}
{"Input":"\"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had","Output":"not given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!"}
{"Input":"I wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.","Output":"We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,"}
{"Input":"I have done very little besides sending away some of the large","Output":"looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's."}

{"Input":"so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,","Output":"and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,"}
{"Input":"how to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own","Output":"knowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward"}

{"Input":"of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with","Output":"a second spring of youth and beauty."}
{"Input":"you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,","Output":"though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her's"}
{"Input":"a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth","Output":"and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains"}
{"Input":"Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,","Output":"that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself."}
{"Input":"when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth","Output":"of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do"}
{"Input":"Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,","Output":"which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,"}

{"Input":"and he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself","Output":"most willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been"}
{"Input":"One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.","Output":"And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you"}
{"Input":"After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.","Output":"Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,"}
{"Input":"he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.","Output":"Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance"}
{"Input":"Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa","Output":"had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on"}
{"Input":"She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive","Output":"the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of"}

{"Input":"\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward","Output":"to meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart"}
{"Input":"a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her","Output":"so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,"}
{"Input":"Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with","Output":"partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,"}
{"Input":"too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct","Output":"opinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less"}
{"Input":"Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,","Output":"and she was all but calling there in the same half hour."}
{"Input":"While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?","Output":"Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,"}
{"Input":"but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.","Output":"They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and"}
{"Input":"or in any novelty or enlargement of society.  No one had ever","Output":"come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with"}
{"Input":"that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,","Output":"she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone"}
{"Input":"But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"","Output":"Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness"}
{"Input":"of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,","Output":"and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,"}
{"Input":"as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings","Output":"with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,"}
{"Input":"it might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family","Output":"will always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\""}
{"Input":"He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,","Output":"for two or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it."}
{"Input":"Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold","Output":"more than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;"}
{"Input":"of seeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter","Output":"was wise."}
{"Input":"If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,","Output":"who could wonder?"}
{"Input":"and a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful","Output":"to anybody that will bring him his wife.\""}
{"Input":"pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are","Output":"settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find"}

{"Input":"not having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,","Output":"and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,"}
{"Input":"but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and","Output":"Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described"}
{"Input":"as she unlocked it, said--","Output":"\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;"}
{"Input":"when she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles","Output":"of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch."}
{"Input":"the sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement","Output":"for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;"}
{"Input":"to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.","Output":"My line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently"}
{"Input":"of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth","Output":"fell on Anne."}
{"Input":"She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,","Output":"and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place."}
{"Input":"I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,","Output":"except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome."}
{"Input":"you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,","Output":"the last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect"}
{"Input":"There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion","Output":"in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret;"}
{"Input":"led by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by","Output":"his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification"}
{"Input":"so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--","Output":"\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home"}
{"Input":"The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was","Output":"no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,"}
{"Input":"Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"","Output":"\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,"}
{"Input":"for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"","Output":"\"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit"}
{"Input":"near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,","Output":"the other a widow."}
{"Input":"Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,","Output":"not to be breathed beyond their own circle."}
{"Input":"pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,","Output":"had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,"}
{"Input":"when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\"","Output":"\"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,"}
{"Input":"in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment;","Output":"more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly"}
{"Input":"and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.","Output":"Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;"}
{"Input":"and the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything","Output":"to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun"}
{"Input":"he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money,","Output":"and a right to spend it as he liked."}
{"Input":"The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost","Output":"beyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,"}
{"Input":"in aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk","Output":"would have been incurred, and all duty violated.\""}
{"Input":"the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne;","Output":"but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His sanguine temper,"}
{"Input":"of exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward","Output":"in the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing"}
{"Input":"the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,","Output":"if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural"}

{"Input":"of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,","Output":"receiving her in that house, there was particular attention."}
{"Input":"those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,","Output":"she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,"}
{"Input":"Lady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had","Output":"been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced"}
{"Input":"Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,","Output":"their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;"}
{"Input":"for himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch","Output":"and of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him."}
{"Input":"I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired","Output":"of your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,"}
{"Input":"put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape","Output":"with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety"}
{"Input":"eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,","Output":"and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else"}
{"Input":"Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,","Output":"while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was"}
{"Input":"that he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into","Output":"the Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible;","Output":"but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,"}
{"Input":"if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well,","Output":"this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick."}
{"Input":"to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge","Output":"of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him."}
{"Input":"shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my","Output":"little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing"}
{"Input":"Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,","Output":"a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door"}
{"Input":"of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,","Output":"and would call for them in a few minutes."}
{"Input":"the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain","Output":"every twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,"}
{"Input":"\"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!","Output":"how those little fingers of yours fly about!\""}
{"Input":"and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left","Output":"to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them"}
{"Input":"added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.","Output":"He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,"}
{"Input":"of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him","Output":"was gone for ever."}

{"Input":"behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report,","Output":"to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding."}
{"Input":"disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;","Output":"and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,"}
{"Input":"than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy","Output":"with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself"}

{"Input":"could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly","Output":"in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral"}

{"Input":"Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,","Output":"it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as"}
{"Input":"and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility","Output":"of England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\""}
{"Input":"They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were","Output":"at the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;"}
{"Input":"Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really","Output":"did; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"Louisa.\""}
{"Input":"pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in","Output":"this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving"}
{"Input":"and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.","Output":"His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene"}

{"Input":"Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,","Output":"and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt"}

{"Input":"Do not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to","Output":"cousin Charles.\""}
{"Input":"This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval","Output":"of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man"}
{"Input":"Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him,","Output":"though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able"}
{"Input":"you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson","Output":"and her daughters.\""}
{"Input":"He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,","Output":"without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,"}
{"Input":"in the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children","Output":"as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;"}
{"Input":"fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining","Output":"happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,"}
{"Input":"did decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who","Output":"did not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;"}

{"Input":"till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,","Output":"be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once"}
{"Input":"to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth","Output":"was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe."}
{"Input":"it was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded","Output":"back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,"}
{"Input":"an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to","Output":"so much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly."}
{"Input":"in the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding","Output":"to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions"}
