{"Input":"And Buster Bear was just exactly right.\r","Output":"\r"}

{"Input":"Brown's boy had run away from Buster Bear without even seeing him,--soon\r","Output":"spread all over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, until\r"}

{"Input":"sheer delight. Now Buster had reached the Old Pasture just as jolly,\r","Output":"round, red Mr. Sun had crept out of bed, and he had fully made up his\r"}
{"Input":"down to think what he wanted for breakfast.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"looking at the matter as Little Joe did, it amounted to the same thing.\r","Output":"You see, Buster knew perfectly well when he invited Little Joe to come\r"}
{"Input":"very angry, but they were so afraid of him that they didn't dare do\r","Output":"anything about it. But when they discovered that Buster Bear was a\r"}
{"Input":"Farmer Brown's boy so that he would keep away from there. It would be a\r","Output":"favor to me which Ah cert'nly would appreciate,\" said Unc' Billy Possum\r"}
{"Input":"Mr. Toad. On the other side of the Smiling Pool were Reddy Fox, Digger\r","Output":"the Badger, and Bobby Coon. In the Big Hickory-tree were Chatterer the\r"}
{"Input":"exactly as it was, but you know he was very badly frightened at the\r","Output":"time.\r"}
{"Input":"didn't need to be told whose voice that was. It was the voice of Farmer\r","Output":"Brown's boy. Right then and there Buster Bear nearly had a fit. There\r"}

{"Input":"Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear.\r","Output":"\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"I'm going fishing,\" said he in his deep grumbly-rumbly voice to no one\r"}
{"Input":"\"I don't believe it. I don't believe a word of it. Farmer Brown's boy\r","Output":"isn't afraid of any one who lives in the Green Forest or on the Green\r"}
{"Input":"\"They are _our_ fish!\" said Little Joe fiercely. \"He has no business\r","Output":"catching _our_ fish!\"\r"}
{"Input":"within hearing to come and see him was more than he could stand. It\r","Output":"seemed to Buster as if everybody who lives in the Green Forest, on the\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"A dozen times a day Buster would hear them screaming this. He would\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL JUMPS FOR HIS LIFE\r"}

{"Input":"Forest. He couldn't keep it to himself a minute longer than he had to.\r","Output":"So he hurried to the Smiling Pool, where he was sure he would find Billy\r"}
{"Input":"dreamed about the delicious dinner of fried trout he would have the next\r","Output":"day, and now--well, if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon, that\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Now Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that Buster Bear had come down to the\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Then something happened. Yes, Sir, something happened. Farmer Brown's\r"}
{"Input":"So very early the next morning Little Joe Otter went to the best fishing\r","Output":"pool he knew of in the Laughing Brook, and there he caught the biggest\r"}
{"Input":"At first Little Joe didn't want to, but at last his curiosity got the\r","Output":"better of his fear, and he agreed. So the two little brown-coated scamps\r"}
{"Input":"grew thick and oh, so big, and all the time he kept his eyes wide open,\r","Output":"and he kept his ears open too.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"where you can watch, you will be able to see for yourselves if Little\r","Output":"Joe Otter is right. Now what do you say?\"\r"}
{"Input":"to listen. He never had heard a cry just like it before. At first he\r","Output":"couldn't make out just what it was or where it came from. But one thing\r"}
{"Input":"Now Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that Buster Bear had come down to the\r","Output":"Green Forest to live. He never had heard of a Bear being in the Green\r"}
{"Input":"day and a little more. First had come the fright back there in the Old\r","Output":"Pasture. Then the pail had slipped down behind his ears and held fast,\r"}
{"Input":"Farmer Brown's boy really was afraid of Buster Bear.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"as completely as if they never had been, and Old Man Coyote had taken\r","Output":"care to leave no trace of his visit. Farmer Brown's boy gaped foolishly\r"}
{"Input":"Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from another tree, held _their_\r","Output":"breath. Unc' Billy Possum, sticking his head out from a hollow tree,\r"}

{"Input":"Farmer Brown's boy had just stepped out from behind one side of a little\r","Output":"hemlock-tree and Buster Bear had just stepped out from behind the\r"}
{"Input":"again--\"Help! Help! Help\"--and it was very faint and sounded terribly\r","Output":"frightened. He waited a minute or two, but heard nothing more. Then he\r"}
{"Input":"and he kept his ears open too.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"caught the fat trout just as it was slipping back into the water.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"asked Farmer Brown's boy of his mother.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"Buster Bear shuffling along towards the Laughing Brook. Suddenly Buster\r","Output":"stopped and sniffed. One of the Merry Little Breezes had carried the\r"}
{"Input":"nearly tumbled down with terror. The worst of it was there wasn't\r","Output":"another tree near enough for him to jump to. He was in trouble this\r"}
{"Input":"taunted Peter.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"of the Laughing Brook. Somehow, it seemed to Buster as if the Brook were\r","Output":"laughing at him.\r"}
{"Input":"Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay making a great fuss near the edge of the\r","Output":"Green Forest, he never once thought of Buster Bear, as he started over\r"}
{"Input":"Little Joe just sniffed and went off declaring that he would get even\r","Output":"with Buster Bear yet. Now Little Joe is good-natured and full of fun as\r"}
{"Input":"contain himself. He felt that he had the greatest news to tell since\r","Output":"Peter Rabbit had first found the tracks of Buster Bear in the Green\r"}
{"Input":"seem to think he is. It is a very simple plan, and if you will all hide\r","Output":"where you can watch, you will be able to see for yourselves if Little\r"}
{"Input":"\"He'll try it again to-morrow morning,\" said Little Joe. \"I'll keep\r","Output":"watch, and as soon as I see him coming, I'll drive out all the fish,\r"}
{"Input":"You see when he had found the heads of those trout on the bank he knew\r","Output":"right away that some one else had been fishing, and that was why he\r"}
{"Input":"Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter. \"I'm not through with you\r","Output":"either, Peter Rabbit!\" he snarled. \"You'll find it out one of these fine\r"}
{"Input":"day, and now--well, if he didn't catch some trout pretty soon, that\r","Output":"splendid dinner would never be anything but a dream.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown's henhouse and scare\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"He walked over to the place where the pail had been, and then he\r"}
{"Input":"Green Meadows, and the Smiling Pool are so used to hearing Sammy cry\r","Output":"thief that usually they think very little about it. But every blessed\r"}
{"Input":"and whined and squealed. He tried to back out of the pail and couldn't.\r","Output":"He tried to shake it off and couldn't. He tried to pull it off, but\r"}

{"Input":"Grandfather Frog. He is very old and very wise. Anyway, that is what his\r","Output":"neighbors think. The truth is, he simply has a lot of common sense,\r"}
{"Input":"edge of it and didn't move. Buster learned a long time ago that a\r","Output":"fisherman must be patient unless, like Little Joe Otter, he is just as\r"}
{"Input":"he had really made it easier for Buster to catch all the fish he wanted,\r","Output":"Little Joe went off down to the Smiling Pool in a great rage.\r"}
{"Input":"it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some\r","Output":"for himself.\r"}
{"Input":"berrying. While he was walking around in the Green Forest, talking to\r","Output":"himself about how hungry he was for some berries and how sure he was\r"}
{"Input":"He heard Chatterer the Red Squirrel scolding as fast as he could make\r","Output":"his tongue go and working himself into a terrible rage. \"Must be that\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"BUSTER BEAR CARRIES OFF THE PAIL OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY\r"}
{"Input":"listened until he couldn't stand it another minute. He just _had_ to\r","Output":"know what it was all about. So at the same time Farmer Brown's boy\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"All the way home through the Green Forest, Farmer Brown's boy kept\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Now tell me that he isn't afraid!\" concluded Little Joe. \"For once he\r"}
{"Input":"tail, that funny little tail he is so fond of jerking when he scolds.\r","Output":"This helped him too. It helped him keep his balance and keep from\r"}
{"Input":"the other. Then he went on to another, and this was no better. Buster\r","Output":"sat down and scratched his head. It was puzzling. Yes, Sir, it was\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Down, down, down he sailed and landed on his feet. Of course, he hit the\r"}
{"Input":"of the little people of the Green Forest and some from the Green Meadows\r","Output":"saw him. When Farmer Brown's boy came hurrying home from the Laughing\r"}
{"Input":"Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great\r","Output":"joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe to come and get his fish.\r"}
{"Input":"  Couldn't catch a buzzing fly!\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Now Buster Bear had lived by himself in the Great Woods so long that\r"}
{"Input":"Presently Buster heard light footsteps, and peeping out, he saw Billy\r","Output":"Mink and Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Prickly Porky and Reddy\r"}
{"Input":"Buster is so fond of berries that from the very second that his greedy\r","Output":"little eyes saw that pailful, he forgot everything but the feast that\r"}
{"Input":"in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice. \"I've saved a fat trout for\r","Output":"you to make up for the one I ate yesterday. I hope we'll go fishing\r"}
{"Input":"something else on his mind. You have made a hero of Buster Bear, because\r","Output":"you believe Little Joe's story. Now I don't say that I don't believe it,\r"}
{"Input":"farther he went down the Laughing Brook, the more puzzled Farmer Brown's\r","Output":"boy grew. It made him feel very queer. He would have felt still more\r"}
{"Input":"The more exciting it is, the better he likes it. Then he has a chance to\r","Output":"use that harsh voice of his, and how he does use it!\r"}
{"Input":"let Little Joe have his own way in everything.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, who, because they can fly,\r"}
{"Input":"little Mr. Gartersnake, and what do you think he was doing? Well, I\r","Output":"don't like to tell you, but he was trying to swallow one of the children\r"}
{"Input":"  Who makes an enemy a friend,\r","Output":"  To fear and worry puts an end.\r"}
{"Input":"to see what was going on.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"all, just nothing at all. But the funniest thing of all is this--he took\r","Output":"that pail with him! Yes, Sir, Buster Bear ran away with the big tin pail\r"}
{"Input":"who have plenty of just plain common sense are often thought to be very\r","Output":"wise. Their neighbors look up to them and are forever running to them\r"}
{"Input":"most of them were very much afraid of him, they had hard work to believe\r","Output":"that he would really be afraid of even such a great, big, strong fellow\r"}
{"Input":"Billy Possum chuckled. \"Ah believe yo' are right again, Brer Otter,\"\r","Output":"said he. \"It cert'nly does look so. If Brer Bear isn't scared, he must\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Just then one of Buster's big paws went into the water as quick as a\r"}
{"Input":"Buster's little eyes twinkled, and he smacked his lips as he moved on\r","Output":"to the next little pool, for he knew that it was of no use to stay\r"}
{"Input":"into the water and chased all the fish out of the little pool, and\r","Output":"stirred up the mud on the bottom so that the water was so muddy that the\r"}
{"Input":"ones there. Buster blinked his greedy little eyes rapidly and looked\r","Output":"again. No, he wasn't dreaming. They were real berries, and all he had\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"It was a long, long, long way down to the ground, and it certainly\r"}
{"Input":"water was so dirty that Buster couldn't have seen a fish right under his\r","Output":"nose. He did the same thing in the next pool and the next. Buster Bear's\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"and there was nowhere else for them to go. When they came to the place\r","Output":"where Buster was waiting, all he had to do was to scoop them out on to\r"}
{"Input":"\"Here's your trout, Mr. Otter,\" said he, as Little Joe put his head out\r","Output":"of water to see who had frightened him so. \"Come and get it.\"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"So now, as he sat in the top of the Big Hickory-tree beside the Smiling\r"}
{"Input":"caught, he moved along to the next little pool.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"the worst fit of temper ever seen in the Green Forest. And the worst\r","Output":"part of it all was that all his neighbors of the Green Forest and a\r"}
{"Input":"thief that usually they think very little about it. But every blessed\r","Output":"one who heard Sammy this morning stopped whatever he was doing and\r"}
{"Input":"berries greedily. His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment, and he didn't\r","Output":"mind at all if now and then he got leaves, and some green berries in his\r"}
{"Input":"bully, Buster Bear. He took that fat trout away from me and ate it just\r","Output":"as if it belonged to him! I hate him! If I live long enough I'm going to\r"}
{"Input":"in which he was hiding, held _his_ breath. Reddy Fox, lying flat down\r","Output":"behind a heap of brush, held _his_ breath. Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt\r"}
{"Input":"everybody else within hearing what they thought of him. They delighted\r","Output":"in flying about through the Green Forest until they had found Buster\r"}
{"Input":"Drummer the Woodpecker, Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the Chickadee, Jenny\r","Output":"Wren, Redeye the Vireo, and ever so many more. They came from the Old\r"}
{"Input":"of Farmer Brown's boy! You see when it slipped off his head, the handle\r","Output":"was still around his neck, and there he was running away with a pail\r"}
{"Input":"  They are no worse; they're not so bad!\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\"Thief, thief, thief!\" screamed Sammy until his throat was sore. The\r","Output":"worst of it was Buster knew that everybody knew that it was true. That\r"}
{"Input":"sheepishly he started for home to tell of all the strange things that\r","Output":"had happened to him in the Old Pasture. Two or three times, as he\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"And he won't dare set any more traps for me,\" gloated Billy Mink.\r"}
{"Input":"Little Joe Otter was in a terrible rage. It was a bad beginning for a\r","Output":"beautiful day and Little Joe knew it. But who wouldn't be in a rage if\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"And that is just what Buster Bear was doing, and it was very plain to\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"So when he started to look for berries, he made up his mind that he\r"}
{"Input":"have remembered something impo'tant and has gone to attend to it in a\r","Output":"powerful hurry.\"\r"}
{"Input":"see it. It is bad enough to give way to temper when you are all alone,\r","Output":"and there is no one to watch you, but when you let temper get the best\r"}
{"Input":"said he. \"Who does he belong to?\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberries he ever had seen in all\r","Output":"his life! Now if there is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"making the teeniest, weeniest sound. And that is how it happened that no\r","Output":"one saw him or heard him until just as Farmer Brown's boy stepped out\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Buster Bear hadn't enjoyed himself so much since he came to the Green\r"}
{"Input":"By and by the back door of Farmer Brown's house opened, and out stepped\r","Output":"Farmer Brown's boy. In each hand he carried a milk pail. Right away\r"}
{"Input":"right out of his head, and it was right then that he felt his hair rise.\r","Output":"Anyway, that is what he said when he told about it afterward. What was\r"}
{"Input":"Redwing were there, and Blacky the Crow was sitting in the Big\r","Output":"Hickory-tree.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"A SURPRISING THING HAPPENS\r"}
{"Input":"surprise and delight. Right in front of him was a shiny thing just full\r","Output":"of the finest, biggest, bluest berries! There were no leaves or green\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"This was bad enough, but to make matters worse, just at that very minute\r"}
{"Input":"a big tin pail, and in the bottom of it, wrapped up in a piece of paper,\r","Output":"was a lunch, for he meant to stay until he filled that pail, if it took\r"}
{"Input":"boy run away, they looked on Buster Bear with a great deal of respect\r","Output":"and were very proud of him.\r"}
{"Input":"his eyes from Farmer Brown's back door. What was he watching for? Why,\r","Output":"for Farmer Brown's boy to come out on his way to milk the cows.\r"}
{"Input":"the Old Pasture that made his smile still broader. He saw Farmer Brown's\r","Output":"boy filling a great tin pail with blueberries, and he knew that Farmer\r"}
{"Input":"to-morrow morning, and get everybody else to come that you can, perhaps\r","Output":"I will tell you.\"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"LITTLE JOE OTTER SUPPLIES BUSTER BEAR WITH A BREAKFAST\r"}
{"Input":"he had hurried to drive whoever it was away. It hadn't entered his head\r","Output":"that it could be anybody who would eat those berries.\r"}
{"Input":"got to his feet and shook himself. Then he walked over to a big\r","Output":"pine-tree, stood up on his hind legs, reached as high up on the trunk of\r"}
{"Input":"he began to laugh, as he thought of how funny Buster Bear had looked\r","Output":"with the pail about his neck, and then because, you know he is learning\r"}
{"Input":"Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of.\r","Output":"Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great\r"}
{"Input":"book about his adventures, and Old Mr. Toad is such a good friend of all\r","Output":"of us that I am going to do it.\r"}
{"Input":"  And hides himself the livelong day!\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"or not; it's true,\" he retorted. Then he told how early that very\r","Output":"morning he and Buster Bear had been fishing together in the Laughing\r"}
{"Input":"boy filling a great tin pail with blueberries, and he knew that Farmer\r","Output":"Brown's boy didn't know that Buster Bear was anywhere about, and he knew\r"}
{"Input":"do! I'll go up there at the very first peep of day to-morrow. I can eat\r","Output":"all I want and get back to the Green Forest before there is any danger\r"}
{"Input":"softly so as not to make a sound. It was Buster Bear.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"sat down and scratched his head. It was puzzling. Yes, Sir, it was\r","Output":"puzzling. He looked this way and he looked that way suspiciously, but\r"}
{"Input":"Of course Mrs. Brown promised that she would, and so that night Farmer\r","Output":"Brown's boy went to bed very early that he might get up early in the\r"}
{"Input":"climbed very far up in the blue, blue sky. You see, big as he is and\r","Output":"strong as he is, Buster Bear is very shy and bashful, and he has no\r"}

{"Input":"There is nothing quite like common sense to smooth out troubles. People\r","Output":"who have plenty of just plain common sense are often thought to be very\r"}
{"Input":"the berries. Yes, it was perfectly harmless. Buster gave a little sigh\r","Output":"of pure happiness. He would eat those berries to the last one, and then\r"}
{"Input":"with the yell Farmer Brown's boy turned and ran for home, as no one ever\r","Output":"had seen him run before. He ran just as Peter Rabbit runs when he has\r"}
{"Input":"you to make up for the one I ate yesterday. I hope we'll go fishing\r","Output":"together often.\"\r"}
{"Input":"face, gazing into each other's eyes, while everybody watched and waited,\r","Output":"and it seemed as if the whole Green Forest was holding its breath.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Grandfather Frog looked up at jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun and slowly\r"}
{"Input":"wonder what I'd better do with it.\" And while he was wondering, he ate\r","Output":"it all up. Then he started down the Laughing Brook to try to catch some\r"}
{"Input":"\"I--I hope so,\" replied Little Joe.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"is to make friends with Buster Bear. I'll try it to-morrow morning.\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"puzzling. He looked this way and he looked that way suspiciously, but\r","Output":"there was no one to be seen. Everything was still save for the laughter\r"}
{"Input":"Little Joe made a good-natured face at Billy Mink and shook his head.\r","Output":"\"No, Billy,\" said he, \"you are wrong, altogether wrong. I don't believe\r"}
{"Input":"bottom couldn't be seen at all. Then he hurried down to the next little\r","Output":"pool and did the same thing.\r"}
{"Input":"hanging about his neck. He whistled. It was a comical little whistle of\r","Output":"chagrin as he realized that he had nothing in which to put more berries,\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"make sure that if Little Joe were watching for him, as he was sure he\r","Output":"would be, he would see him coming. Then, instead of keeping on to the\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Chuckling happily over Buster Bear's great fright, Farmer Brown's boy\r"}
{"Input":"SOMEBODY ELSE GOES BERRYING\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"could have eaten all those trout, and Farmer Brown's boy didn't once\r","Output":"think of Little Joe Otter, and so he was very, very much puzzled.\r"}
{"Input":"So now, as he sat in the top of the Big Hickory-tree beside the Smiling\r","Output":"Pool and looked down on all the little people gathered there, he was\r"}
{"Input":"\"Of course it's true!\" snapped Little Joe Otter. \"Don't you believe I'm\r","Output":"telling the truth?\"\r"}
{"Input":"\"He's fishing!\" exclaimed Billy Mink.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\"If I wasn't afraid of being seen, I'd go up to the Old Pasture this\r","Output":"very minute. Seems as if I could taste those berries.\" He licked his\r"}
{"Input":"  To smile and say, \"I'm mighty glad\r","Output":"  They are no worse; they're not so bad!\"\r"}
{"Input":"him berries. He isn't particular what kind of berries. Raspberries,\r","Output":"blackberries, or blueberries, either kind, will make him perfectly\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"If he is so afraid of me, I guess I needn't be afraid of him,\" said\r"}
{"Input":"tree. He hadn't known that Buster could climb. But Buster is a splendid\r","Output":"climber, especially when the tree is big and stout as this one was, and\r"}
{"Input":"own eyes, and he had a queer feeling all over,--a little chilly feeling,\r","Output":"although it was a warm day. Somehow, he didn't feel like meeting Buster\r"}
{"Input":"Buster Bear was having the finest time he had had since he came down\r","Output":"from the Great Woods to live in the Green Forest. To be sure, he wasn't\r"}
{"Input":"softly, so as not to frighten the fish. Then he sat down close to the\r","Output":"edge of it and didn't move. Buster learned a long time ago that a\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"What is it?\" asked Sammy Jay eagerly.\r"}
{"Input":"brought this habit of talking to himself down to the Green Forest, where\r","Output":"he had many more neighbors than he had in the Great Woods.\r"}
{"Input":"frightened. He waited a minute or two, but heard nothing more. Then he\r","Output":"put down his pail and began a hurried look here, there, and everywhere.\r"}
{"Input":"Just then one of Buster's big paws went into the water as quick as a\r","Output":"flash and scooped out a trout that had ventured too near.\r"}
{"Input":"\"If I didn't know that nobody else comes fishing here, I should think\r","Output":"that somebody had been here this very morning and caught all the fish or\r"}
{"Input":"Peter Rabbit had first found the tracks of Buster Bear in the Green\r","Output":"Forest. He couldn't keep it to himself a minute longer than he had to.\r"}
{"Input":"one reason that he is so often impudent and saucy. But once in a while a\r","Output":"great fear takes possession of him, as when he knows that Shadow the\r"}
{"Input":"had to laugh in spite of himself. So did Grandfather Frog. So did Jerry\r","Output":"Muskrat, who had been listening. Of course this made Little Joe angrier\r"}
{"Input":"so well that he couldn't imagine him afraid. Reddy doubted because he\r","Output":"didn't want to believe. You see, he was jealous of Buster Bear, and at\r"}
{"Input":"which, you know, is as fast as he can run. Once he stumbled and fell,\r","Output":"but he scrambled to his feet in a twinkling, and away he went without\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"And then, because Buster Bear always enjoys a good joke even when it is\r"}
{"Input":"caught sight of Buster Bear running for the Green Forest as hard as ever\r","Output":"he could, he understood what had excited Sammy so. He was so surprised\r"}
{"Input":"because he was so big and strong. But they were still more afraid of\r","Output":"Farmer Brown's boy, because they didn't know him or understand him, and\r"}
{"Input":"everybody lost a great deal of the respect for Buster which they had\r","Output":"felt. It is always that way. They began to say unkind things about him.\r"}

{"Input":"the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and all the\r","Output":"others know it. Blacky likes excitement. He wants something going on.\r"}
{"Input":"he is, and perhaps a little bit smarter. Spite and selfishness were at\r","Output":"the bottom of it. You see Little Joe and Billy Mink had had all the\r"}

{"Input":"Muskrat, who had been listening. Of course this made Little Joe angrier\r","Output":"than ever. He said a lot of unkind things about Buster Bear and about\r"}
{"Input":"away from the Smiling Pool. So it was agreed that Blacky should try his\r","Output":"plan the very next morning.\r"}
{"Input":"Nearer and nearer came Buster Bear, and deeper and angrier sounded his\r","Output":"voice. Chatterer gave a little frightened gasp and looked this way and\r"}

{"Input":"likely to meet one of them in the Old Pasture than deep in the Green\r","Output":"Forest.\r"}
{"Input":"of the Green Forest where it joins the Old Pasture. It moved very\r","Output":"swiftly and silently, as if in a great hurry. Sammy knew who it was: it\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"Buster Bear yawned as he lay on his comfortable bed of leaves and\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Little Joe couldn't find a word to say.\r"}

{"Input":"he looked back again, the trout was nowhere to be seen. Buster couldn't\r","Output":"have stolen up and taken it, because such a big fellow couldn't possibly\r"}

{"Input":"and the foolish green flies that I haven't caught?\" asked Grandfather\r","Output":"Frog.\r"}
{"Input":"they could. Farmer Brown's boy took the two pails of milk into the\r","Output":"house, then out he came and started straight for the Green Forest. He\r"}
{"Input":"  There's nothing quite at all like it\r","Output":"    To spoil a pleasant day.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Hi!\" cried Billy Mink. \"Look at Little Joe Otter! It must be that for\r"}
{"Input":"Buster hadn't been so frightened himself, he might have recognized that\r","Output":"second yell as one of fright, for that is what it was. You see Farmer\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"Sammy was on the lookout very early the next morning. The first Jolly\r"}

{"Input":"seemed as if Farmer Brown's boy never would come out, but at last he\r","Output":"did. Blacky and Sammy Jay at once began to scream and make all the fuss\r"}
{"Input":"berries than he had ever seen together at one time in all his life, and\r","Output":"all he had to do was to eat and eat and eat. And that is just what he\r"}
{"Input":"before he got there. Then he told how Farmer Brown's boy had found a\r","Output":"footprint of Buster Bear in the soft mud, and how he had stopped fishing\r"}
{"Input":"that somebody had been here this very morning and caught all the fish or\r","Output":"else frightened them so that they are all in hiding,\" said he, as he\r"}

{"Input":"great fear takes possession of him, as when he knows that Shadow the\r","Output":"Weasel is looking for him. You see, he knows that Shadow can go wherever\r"}
{"Input":"shook his head very soberly when Little Joe had been disrespectful to\r","Output":"him.\r"}
{"Input":"Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, Unc' Billy Possum, Striped Chipmunk and Old\r","Output":"Mr. Toad. On the other side of the Smiling Pool were Reddy Fox, Digger\r"}

{"Input":"    To work the other way.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"And that is just what Buster Bear was doing, and it was very plain to\r","Output":"see that he was having great fun. When he had eaten the trout he had\r"}

{"Input":"you believe Little Joe's story. Now I don't say that I don't believe it,\r","Output":"but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown's boy is\r"}

{"Input":"others,--Redtail the Hawk, Scrapper the Kingbird, Redwing the Blackbird,\r","Output":"Drummer the Woodpecker, Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the Chickadee, Jenny\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"So now they were very proud to think that one of their own number\r"}
{"Input":"he said:\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"is hungry, and this time he had had no breakfast, you know.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"mind at all if now and then he got leaves, and some green berries in his\r","Output":"mouth with the big ripe berries. He didn't try to get them out. Oh, my,\r"}

{"Input":"and then, taking the greatest care to keep out of sight of any trout\r","Output":"that might be in the little pool, he began to fish. Now Farmer Brown's\r"}

{"Input":"Buster had been too smart for Little Joe, it tickled him so that Billy\r","Output":"had to laugh in spite of himself. So did Grandfather Frog. So did Jerry\r"}

{"Input":"but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown's boy is\r","Output":"afraid of Buster when I see him run away myself. Now here is my plan:\r"}

{"Input":"his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about to eat it? Anyway,\r","Output":"that is what Little Joe told Billy Mink. Perhaps he didn't tell it quite\r"}
{"Input":"think of Little Joe Otter, and so he was very, very much puzzled.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"and come.\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\"I'd like to know what you're making such a fuss about, Mr. Crow, but\r","Output":"I've got to feed the cows and milk them first,\" said he.\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"A dozen times a day Buster would hear them screaming this. He would\r","Output":"grind his teeth and glare up at them, but that was all he could do. He\r"}

{"Input":"like a great joke to Buster Bear, and he had chuckled over it all the\r","Output":"time he was eating the fat trout. When he had finished it, he started on\r"}
{"Input":"and as hard as he otherwise would have done, because being spread out so\r","Output":"flat that way, the air held him up a little. And then there was his\r"}

{"Input":"delighted when he heard how Buster Bear had been too smart for Little\r","Output":"Joe Otter. It tickled him so that he had hard work to keep a straight\r"}
{"Input":"he had first heard some one in the bushes where he had hidden his pail\r","Output":"of berries, he had been very sure that it was one of the cows or young\r"}
{"Input":"of pure happiness. He would eat those berries to the last one, and then\r","Output":"he would go home to the Green Forest.\r"}
{"Input":"where Buster was waiting, all he had to do was to scoop them out on to\r","Output":"the bank. It was great fun. It didn't take Buster long to catch all the\r"}

{"Input":"\"They were no more your fish than mine,\" protested Billy Mink.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"Little Joe Otter swam straight to the Big Rock and climbed up to the\r","Output":"very highest part. He looked so excited, and his eyes sparkled so, that\r"}

{"Input":"sure of that!\" he snapped. \"I'm not through with him yet.\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"Now though Buster didn't know it, some one had been listening, and that\r","Output":"some one was none other than Sammy Jay. When at last Buster lay down\r"}
{"Input":"With a roar of anger Buster Bear charged out of his hiding place. He\r","Output":"rushed this way and that way! He roared with all his might! He was very\r"}
{"Input":"and the Green Meadows who do not know fear at some time or other, but it\r","Output":"comes to Chatterer as seldom as to any one, because he is very sure of\r"}
{"Input":"all he was out of sight. Altogether it was the most surprising thing\r","Output":"that the little people of the Green Forest ever had seen.\r"}
{"Input":"And so they reached the edge of the Green Forest, Buster Bear running as\r","Output":"hard as ever he could, Sammy Jay flying just behind him and screaming,\r"}
{"Input":"It's a fact. Blacky the Crow is forever dreaming and scheming and almost\r","Output":"always it is of mischief. He is one of the smartest and cleverest of all\r"}
{"Input":"there too, sometimes, and this always made Little Joe and Billy Mink\r","Output":"very angry, but they were so afraid of him that they didn't dare do\r"}
{"Input":"    When things go wrong\r","Output":"  Blacky is a screamer!\r"}
{"Input":"Brown's boy had been afraid at the mere sight of one of Buster Bear's\r","Output":"big footprints, they had at once made a hero of Buster. At least some of\r"}

{"Input":"exciting that everybody promised to be there, that is, everybody but\r","Output":"Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, who didn't care to go so far\r"}
{"Input":"Buster Bear was in a terrible temper. Yes, Sir, Buster Bear was having\r","Output":"the worst fit of temper ever seen in the Green Forest. And the worst\r"}
{"Input":"He heard Blacky the Crow cawing at the top of his lungs, and he knew by\r","Output":"the sound that Blacky was getting into mischief of some kind. He heard\r"}
{"Input":"as he did now. He wandered about uneasily. He was hungry--hungry for\r","Output":"berries and nothing else. By and by he began talking to himself again.\r"}
{"Input":"trout he could find. It was so big and fat that it made Little Joe's\r","Output":"mouth water, for you know fat trout are his favorite food. But he didn't\r"}
{"Input":"just as Farmer Brown's boy had yelled at him. Then to have the handle of\r","Output":"the pail slip down around his neck so that he couldn't get rid of the\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"So very early the next morning Little Joe Otter went to the best fishing\r"}
{"Input":"upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide open, held\r","Output":"_his_ breath. And all the other little people who happened to be where\r"}
{"Input":"now he went up after Chatterer, growling angrily.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"couldn't make out just what it was or where it came from. But one thing\r","Output":"he was sure of, and that was that it was a cry of fright. He stood\r"}

{"Input":"when he came to a little muddy place on the bank of the Laughing Brook,\r","Output":"and there he saw something that made his eyes look as if they would pop\r"}
{"Input":"\"Nobody!\" snapped Little Joe. \"What have foolish green flies got to do\r","Output":"with my--I mean _our_ fish?\"\r"}
{"Input":"powerful hurry.\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"It's a fact. Blacky the Crow is forever dreaming and scheming and almost\r"}
{"Input":"  Blacky is a dreamer!\r","Output":"  Blacky is a schemer!\r"}
{"Input":"Yes, Sir, that's what it was, and all it was. But it was the biggest\r","Output":"footprint Farmer Brown's boy ever had seen, and it looked as if it had\r"}
{"Input":"but his patience brought no reward, not so much as the faintest kind of\r","Output":"a nibble. Farmer Brown's boy trudged on to the next pool, and there was\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer Brown's boy meet face to\r"}
{"Input":"as Buster Bear. Every one was so busy watching Farmer Brown's boy that\r","Output":"no one saw Buster coming from the other direction.\r"}
{"Input":"\"It's news--great news!\" cried Little Joe.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"Down, down, down he sailed and landed on his feet. Of course, he hit the\r","Output":"ground pretty hard, and for just a second he quite lost his breath. But\r"}
{"Input":"This helped him too. It helped him keep his balance and keep from\r","Output":"turning over and over.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"\"What's he doing?\" asked Little Joe Otter, as Buster Bear sat for the\r","Output":"longest time without moving.\r"}

{"Input":"\r","Output":"That's a funny thing for hair to do--rise up all of a sudden--isn't it?\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"XXIII\r"}
{"Input":"There is something that I used to have and don't have now. Ha! I know! I\r","Output":"need some fresh fruit. That's it--fresh fruit! It must be about berry\r"}
{"Input":"grumbly-rumbly voice, as he sat on his haunches stripping off the\r","Output":"berries greedily. His little eyes twinkled with enjoyment, and he didn't\r"}
{"Input":"that there must be some up in the Old Pasture, some one else was\r","Output":"thinking about berries and about the Old Pasture too.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Gr-r-r-r!\" growled Buster Bear. \"I'll teach you manners! I'll teach you\r"}
{"Input":"ourselves if it is all true.\"\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"looked to Blacky very much like a tin pail hanging from his neck! No\r","Output":"wonder Sammy was excited. Blacky beat his wings fiercely and started\r"}
{"Input":"Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble, and there was no one to\r","Output":"blame but himself. That is usually the case with those who get into\r"}
{"Input":"Presently he came to another little pool. He stole up to it very, very\r","Output":"softly, so as not to frighten the fish. Then he sat down close to the\r"}
{"Input":"as if some one had just stirred up all the mud at the bottom.\r","Output":"\r"}
{"Input":"queer if he had known that all the time two other fishermen who had been\r","Output":"before him were watching him and chuckling to themselves. They were\r"}
{"Input":"Poor Buster! It was bad enough to be frightened almost to death as he\r","Output":"had been up in the Old Pasture when the pail had caught over his head\r"}
{"Input":"\"Didn't he catch my fish and eat them?\" snapped Little Joe. \"Doesn't\r","Output":"that make him a thief?\"\r"}
{"Input":"That is what Farmer Brown's boy said when he found that Buster Bear had\r","Output":"stolen the berries he had worked so hard to pick and then had run off\r"}
{"Input":"This was bad enough, but to make matters worse, just at that very minute\r","Output":"he heard a shrill, angry voice shout, \"Hi, there! Get out of there!\" He\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Little Joe Otter looked around at all the eager faces watching him, and\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"\"Of course it's true!\" snapped Little Joe Otter. \"Don't you believe I'm\r"}
{"Input":"Buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around. He growled\r","Output":"and whined and squealed. He tried to back out of the pail and couldn't.\r"}
{"Input":"\r","Output":"Isn't it funny how two people will often think of the same thing at the\r"}
