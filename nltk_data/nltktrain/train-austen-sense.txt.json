{"Input":"\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be","Output":"distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall."}
{"Input":"Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,","Output":"quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;"}

{"Input":"and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she","Output":"had never seen Mrs. Ferrars."}
{"Input":"of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of","Output":"the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,"}
{"Input":"exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured","Output":"Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe"}
{"Input":"he wished to engage them for both.","Output":"\"You MUST drink tea with us to night,\" said he,"}
{"Input":"but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature,","Output":"there is no finding out who SHE likes.\""}
{"Input":"and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.","Output":"\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne"}
{"Input":"and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand","Output":"a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the"}

{"Input":"The third day succeeding their knowledge of the","Output":"particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw"}

{"Input":"Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been","Output":"five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;"}
{"Input":"Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from","Output":"motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son"}
{"Input":"time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--","Output":"it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient"}
{"Input":"of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,","Output":"admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother"}
{"Input":"She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards","Output":"its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes"}

{"Input":"and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements","Output":"of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much"}
{"Input":"had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'","Output":"sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was"}
{"Input":"to cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily,","Output":"kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all"}
{"Input":"short time however must now decide what Willoughby's","Output":"intentions were; in all probability he was already in town."}
{"Input":"of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;","Output":"and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;","Output":"not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every"}
{"Input":"ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have","Output":"all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;"}
{"Input":"on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried","Output":"on herself as on her sister."}
{"Input":"to be withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;","Output":"and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off,"}
{"Input":"You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt","Output":"for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter."}
{"Input":"John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival","Output":"of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey"}
{"Input":"from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.","Output":"\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how"}
{"Input":"with some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love","Output":"him tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young"}

{"Input":"as ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember","Output":"last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced"}
{"Input":"in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change","Output":"in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity"}
{"Input":"not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they","Output":"were obliged to wait.  All that could be done was, to sit"}
{"Input":"however it might equally concern them both: she received","Output":"no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at"}

{"Input":"of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.","Output":"\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she."}
{"Input":"saw her spirits less violently irritated than before,","Output":"she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did become"}
{"Input":"as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.","Output":"In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter,"}
{"Input":"for a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,","Output":"who renewed the subject again by saying, with some"}
{"Input":"Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without","Output":"a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete"}
{"Input":"for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,","Output":"and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,"}
{"Input":"From all danger of seeing Willoughby again,","Output":"her mother considered her to be at least equally safe"}
{"Input":"animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage","Output":"to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,"}
{"Input":"without delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at","Output":"first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance"}
{"Input":"whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther","Output":"than Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned"}
{"Input":"\"All this,\" thought Elinor, \"is very pretty;","Output":"but it can impose upon neither of us.\""}
{"Input":"for show, and the Master's ability to support it.","Output":"In spite of the improvements and additions which were"}
{"Input":"heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,","Output":"and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it"}
{"Input":"who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from","Output":"the other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance"}
{"Input":"It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.","Output":"On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind"}
{"Input":"\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income.","Output":"One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own."}
{"Input":"\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"","Output":"said Mrs. Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich"}
{"Input":"What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  How much","Output":"could it not tempt her to forgive!  He had been blamable,"}
{"Input":"but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose","Output":"me to\"--"}

{"Input":"Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can","Output":"make your party without me, or I should have been at my"}

{"Input":"painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.","Output":"During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure."}
{"Input":"beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;","Output":"and that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,"}
{"Input":"would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment","Output":"of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements"}
{"Input":"marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman","Output":"who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could"}
{"Input":"to draw the two others from their pencil and their book,","Output":"in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would"}
{"Input":"it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must","Output":"not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,"}
{"Input":"foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since","Output":"in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural"}
{"Input":"Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John","Output":"was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise"}
{"Input":"\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she,","Output":"after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction"}
{"Input":"she had quite took a fancy to me.  Now was not it so?--","Output":"You saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?\""}
{"Input":"the indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother","Output":"neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable"}
{"Input":"or the consciousness of its being known to others;","Output":"and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying"}
{"Input":"as far as HE is concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you","Output":"of what my feelings have been for him, but what they"}
{"Input":"well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say","Output":"for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark."}
{"Input":"to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.","Output":"He therefore replied, without any resentment,"}
{"Input":"and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;","Output":"and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect"}
{"Input":"of little odd things to do after one has been away for","Output":"any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--"}
{"Input":"Elinor stopped him with a reproof.","Output":"\"Well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye. I shall"}
{"Input":"shocked, confounded.","Output":"Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage,"}
{"Input":"\"Many, many circumstances,\" said Elinor, solemnly.","Output":"\"No, no, no,\" cried Marianne wildly, \"he loves you,"}
{"Input":"intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"","Output":"\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,"}
{"Input":"he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.","Output":"After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,"}
{"Input":"by themselves, \"I come to talk to you of my happiness.","Output":"Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars's way"}
{"Input":"\"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your","Output":"taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome."}

{"Input":"finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,","Output":"if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith","Output":"was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\""}
{"Input":"remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon","Output":"as they were out of the house, his enquiries began."}
{"Input":"her gone!--how teazing to Edward!\"","Output":"\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been"}
{"Input":"Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was","Output":"kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;"}
{"Input":"as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing","Output":"to us in the world.  What answer did you give him?--Did you"}
{"Input":"\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly","Output":"have escaped her memory by THIS time.\""}
{"Input":"might have made her their friend.  Would they only have","Output":"laughed at her about the Doctor!  But so little were they,"}
{"Input":"and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination","Output":"for show, and the Master's ability to support it."}
{"Input":"to describe it--I have pained you too much already.","Output":"That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage"}
{"Input":"indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.","Output":"What else can detain him at Norland?\""}
{"Input":"Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended","Output":"towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was"}
{"Input":"as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,","Output":"by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place"}
{"Input":"to subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,","Output":"and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than"}
{"Input":"greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction","Output":"of their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that"}

{"Input":"and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,","Output":"which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--"}
{"Input":"toward others made every shew of attention and deference","Output":"towards herself perfectly valueless."}
{"Input":"After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that","Output":"Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there,"}
{"Input":"supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,","Output":"you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite"}
{"Input":"of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one","Output":"of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances"}

{"Input":"or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,","Output":"or if he had talked more of one lady than another,"}
{"Input":"off or not.\"","Output":"\"You would not be six hours later,\" said Willoughby,"}
{"Input":"together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.","Output":"So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness"}
{"Input":"in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.","Output":"At last he turned round again, and regarded them both;"}
{"Input":"of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews","Output":"would settle the matter.  In that point, however,"}
{"Input":"against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;","Output":"and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand"}
{"Input":"If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.","Output":"I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at"}
{"Input":"to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,","Output":"and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton."}
{"Input":"from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,","Output":"after some consideration, to say more than she really knew"}
{"Input":"and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained","Output":"with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,"}
{"Input":"this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,","Output":"and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug"}
{"Input":"for a while!  But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong","Output":"proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing"}
{"Input":"in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either","Output":"in curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition"}
{"Input":"away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;","Output":"for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion"}

{"Input":"Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap","Output":"foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced."}
{"Input":"What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made,","Output":"and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage."}
{"Input":"and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that","Output":"dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible."}
{"Input":"secure, till he had revealed his present engagement;","Output":"for the publication of that circumstance, he feared,"}
{"Input":"tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,","Output":"or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug"}
{"Input":"of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the","Output":"drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady"}
{"Input":"The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly","Output":"consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,"}
{"Input":"She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,","Output":"and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\""}
{"Input":"Elinor for a few moments remained silent.","Output":"Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too"}
{"Input":"I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are","Output":"not really wanted.\""}
{"Input":"\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir","Output":"John met him somewhere in the street this morning.\""}
{"Input":"though it proved perfectly different from what she wished","Output":"and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,"}
{"Input":"her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating","Output":"herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained"}
{"Input":"To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which","Output":"each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\""}

{"Input":"But whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure I","Output":"can't tell.  She is an excellent housemaid, and works"}
{"Input":"by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,","Output":"by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire."}
{"Input":"for your sake.\"","Output":"\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am"}
{"Input":"by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at","Output":"my ease among strangers of gentility!\""}
{"Input":"a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having","Output":"much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair"}
{"Input":"for me, and next to Edward's love, it is the greatest","Output":"comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one"}
{"Input":"In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless","Output":"as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him"}
{"Input":"for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man","Output":"to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware"}
{"Input":"His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve","Output":"appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits"}
{"Input":"All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet","Output":"of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother"}
{"Input":"knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.","Output":"The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose"}
{"Input":"actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--","Output":"Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon"}
{"Input":"unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect","Output":"her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was"}
{"Input":"Edward had been staying several weeks in the house","Output":"before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;"}
{"Input":"an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage","Output":"by every possible attention.  He had just compunction"}
{"Input":"by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly","Output":"heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,"}
{"Input":"happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.","Output":"But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the"}
{"Input":"a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.","Output":"A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,"}
{"Input":"At last the affair was decided.  The ivory,","Output":"the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment,"}
{"Input":"to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the","Output":"cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied"}
{"Input":"for that knowledge.","Output":"Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she"}
{"Input":"remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began","Output":"by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,"}
{"Input":"not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,","Output":"and after a moment's silence, said,"}
{"Input":"the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find","Output":"herself more comfortably situated in that particular than"}
{"Input":"Lucy was silenced.","Output":"\"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,\""}
{"Input":"elegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money","Output":"to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,"}
{"Input":"in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it","Output":"much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune"}
{"Input":"He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal","Output":"of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,"}
{"Input":"very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish","Output":"of marrying ME.\""}
{"Input":"\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\"","Output":"said Edward.--\"For worlds would not I have had a letter"}
{"Input":"newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit,","Output":"they had never dined together without his drinking to her"}
{"Input":"the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,","Output":"immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague report had"}
{"Input":"were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been,","Output":"however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL"}
{"Input":"what I mean--if I had been treated in that forbidding","Output":"sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair."}
{"Input":"with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than","Output":"could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's."}
{"Input":"for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood,","Output":"so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say,"}

{"Input":"What had really passed between them was to this effect.","Output":"\"I have heard,\" said he, with great compassion,"}
{"Input":"all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used","Output":"a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I"}
{"Input":"of gratitude and these two words just articulate through","Output":"her tears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and"}

{"Input":"personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother,","Output":"Mrs. Ferrars?\""}

{"Input":"to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,","Output":"and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still"}
{"Input":"Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;","Output":"and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties."}

{"Input":"His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite","Output":"of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret"}

{"Input":"he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel","Output":"for another would do.  He had left the girl whose"}

{"Input":"\"but why should you boast of it?\"","Output":"\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind"}
{"Input":"by absence, unhappiness, and danger.  Elinor's delight,","Output":"as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked"}
{"Input":"\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations","Output":"then are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;"}
{"Input":"somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.","Output":"Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again;"}
{"Input":"I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.","Output":"Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard"}
{"Input":"to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word","Output":"which fell from him while at Barton, and above all"}
{"Input":"You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably","Output":"handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--"}
{"Input":"When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer","Output":"rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself"}
{"Input":"your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will","Output":"be a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place,"}
{"Input":"of that unfortunate girl\"--","Output":"She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words"}
{"Input":"no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open","Output":"and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes."}

{"Input":"\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret;","Output":"\"it was you who told me of it yourself.\""}
{"Input":"not Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,","Output":"and has not his air.\""}
{"Input":"to any body else.  Such conduct made them of course","Output":"most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,"}

{"Input":"that he should like to see her as well as ourselves.\"","Output":"Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know,"}
{"Input":"it might have been odd that he should leave us without","Output":"acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case."}
{"Input":"The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated","Output":"the valley in that direction; under another name,"}
{"Input":"They settled in town, received very liberal assistance","Output":"from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable"}
{"Input":"should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some","Output":"difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still"}
{"Input":"     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself","Output":"     for not having been more guarded in my professions"}
{"Input":"of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and","Output":"of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was"}
{"Input":"for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together","Output":"was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than"}
{"Input":"against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal","Output":"in every body?  Are those who have been disappointed"}
{"Input":"\"I will leave you,\" said Elinor, \"if you will go","Output":"to bed.\" But this, from the momentary perverseness"}
{"Input":"young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was","Output":"an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve."}
{"Input":"Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits","Output":"of her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very"}
{"Input":"or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--","Output":"Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is"}
{"Input":"during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing","Output":"of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;"}
{"Input":"and Edward spends half his time with his sister--besides,","Output":"Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--"}
{"Input":"and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call","Output":"for assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she"}
{"Input":"in confidence of her engagement.\"","Output":"At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment"}
{"Input":"in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,","Output":"said little but what was forced from him by questions,"}
{"Input":"son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,","Output":"and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were"}
{"Input":"she could not reflect without the deepest concern.","Output":"Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she"}
{"Input":"or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he","Output":"used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly"}
{"Input":"consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;","Output":"but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom"}
{"Input":"on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits,","Output":"oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness"}
{"Input":"in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.","Output":"But while the imaginations of other people will carry"}
{"Input":"     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any","Output":"     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you"}
{"Input":"But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  His was","Output":"an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion"}
{"Input":"and sense will always have attractions for me.","Output":"Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty."}
{"Input":"thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for","Output":"after Edward was in possession of the living, but the"}
{"Input":"'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think","Output":"of such a thing?  I write to the Doctor, indeed!'\""}
{"Input":"that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and","Output":"opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth."}
{"Input":"Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily,","Output":"\"Where, pray?\"--"}
{"Input":"of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John","Output":"would not leave the house without securing their promise"}
{"Input":"Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,","Output":"\"She is his natural daughter.\""}
{"Input":"and been under the influence of his countenance and his","Output":"manner, it is probable that her compassion would have"}

{"Input":"people to set it down for certain.\"","Output":"\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,"}
{"Input":"in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT.","Output":"If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy."}
{"Input":"only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that","Output":"she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself,"}

{"Input":"of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared","Output":"everything that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty"}
{"Input":"As soon as they returned to the carriage,","Output":"Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor"}
{"Input":"\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he","Output":"has done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds"}
{"Input":"contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle","Output":"reprimand on the subject five or six times every day."}
{"Input":"\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only","Output":"give happiness where there is nothing else to give it."}
{"Input":"that the room would be wanted for some time.\"","Output":"\"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!"}
{"Input":"since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might","Output":"suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne."}

{"Input":"her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt","Output":"upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of"}

{"Input":"used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly","Output":"observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case"}
{"Input":"what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,","Output":"where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on"}
{"Input":"deal more.  You will be delighted with them I am sure.","Output":"They have brought the whole coach full of playthings"}
{"Input":"by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying","Output":"any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother"}
{"Input":"in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school","Output":"in town to some effect."}

{"Input":"she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from","Output":"which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions"}
{"Input":"than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.","Output":"On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began"}

{"Input":"and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,","Output":"declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,"}
{"Input":"to receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been","Output":"assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards"}
{"Input":"between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,","Output":"and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;"}
{"Input":"Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.","Output":"\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor."}
{"Input":"as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,","Output":"she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other"}
{"Input":"but when this emotion had passed away, she added,","Output":"in a firmer tone,"}
{"Input":"of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,","Output":"that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and"}

{"Input":"her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.","Output":"The interest with which she thus anticipated the"}

{"Input":"She performed her promise of being discreet,","Output":"to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings"}
{"Input":"misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken","Output":"in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,"}

{"Input":"not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and","Output":"be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,"}

{"Input":"told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.","Output":"Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,"}

{"Input":"soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of","Output":"their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,"}
{"Input":"herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,","Output":"while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious"}
{"Input":"and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every","Output":"inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever"}
{"Input":"The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left","Output":"her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded"}

{"Input":"     \"How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on","Output":"     receiving this; and I think you will feel something"}
{"Input":"on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon","Output":"gaining every new light as to his character which her"}

{"Input":"Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure","Output":"of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window."}
{"Input":"toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining","Output":"unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect"}

{"Input":"by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly","Output":"to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself"}
{"Input":"of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.","Output":"Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,"}

{"Input":"their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.","Output":"\"Is there a felicity in the world,\" said Marianne,"}

{"Input":"as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays","Output":"from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,"}
{"Input":"person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion","Output":"she had other claims.  She had been for three months"}
{"Input":"had not known each other a week, I believe, before you","Output":"were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;"}
{"Input":"I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be","Output":"more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly"}
{"Input":"was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise","Output":"precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine"}

{"Input":"And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience","Output":"in the world; the most scrupulous in performing"}
{"Input":"than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong.","Output":"Have I explained away any part of my guilt?\""}
{"Input":"     in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,","Output":"     because we are generally out by one.  We were last"}
{"Input":"I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth","Output":"more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,"}
{"Input":"\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It","Output":"seems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was"}
{"Input":"been to the place.  But so little interest had be taken","Output":"in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,"}
{"Input":"upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we","Output":"shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape"}
{"Input":"an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side","Output":"of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,"}

{"Input":"Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was","Output":"ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession."}
{"Input":"Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively;","Output":"and by relating that she had herself been employed"}

{"Input":"already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.","Output":"But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his"}
{"Input":"of all.","Output":"With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge"}
{"Input":"\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike","Output":"Fanny is enough.  It implies everything amiable."}
{"Input":"and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,","Output":"were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word"}
{"Input":"It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each","Output":"shewed that it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish;"}

{"Input":"their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,","Output":"with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that"}
{"Input":"he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--","Output":"and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton"}

{"Input":"Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.","Output":"She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust."}
{"Input":"Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being","Output":"given her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,"}
{"Input":"with a firm voice.","Output":"\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have"}
{"Input":"she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,","Output":"where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,"}
{"Input":"\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"","Output":"\"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am"}

{"Input":"and was prevented even from wishing it removed,","Output":"by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it."}
{"Input":"Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such","Output":"complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may"}
{"Input":"almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,","Output":"shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,"}
{"Input":"Nothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,","Output":"nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon."}
{"Input":"I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he","Output":"may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away."}
{"Input":"as possible.\"","Output":"Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt"}
{"Input":"have found it impossible to have lived together so long,","Output":"had not a particular circumstance occurred to give"}
{"Input":"in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me,","Output":"as I travelled, in the same look and hue.\""}
{"Input":"followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.","Output":"It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,"}

{"Input":"\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--","Output":"for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has"}

{"Input":"just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor,","Output":"faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I","Output":"thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes."}

{"Input":"carries you too far.\"","Output":"\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself,"}
{"Input":"not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.\"","Output":"Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,"}
{"Input":"But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his","Output":"only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer;"}
{"Input":"you see, if people do but know how to set about it,","Output":"every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage"}
{"Input":"When she told Marianne what she had done, however,","Output":"her first reply was not very auspicious."}
{"Input":"\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\"","Output":"said John, as they were walking together one morning before"}
{"Input":"I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do","Output":"in his heart.\""}
{"Input":"on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,","Output":"that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt"}
{"Input":"to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found","Output":"the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share."}
{"Input":"\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean?","Output":"Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?\""}
{"Input":"very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"","Output":"Marianne here burst forth with indignation--"}
{"Input":"\"My dear ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--","Output":"Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\""}
{"Input":"and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say","Output":"more than once, they should always be glad to see me.--"}
{"Input":"but it can impose upon neither of us.\"","Output":"\"But what,\" said she after a short silence,"}
{"Input":"and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can","Output":"tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining"}

{"Input":"the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's brother,","Output":"Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;"}
{"Input":"but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply","Output":"from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby"}
{"Input":"Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting","Output":"on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding"}
{"Input":"\"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life,","Output":"any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!"}

{"Input":"I watched you all safely out of the house one morning,","Output":"and left my name.\""}
{"Input":"of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite,","Output":"which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,"}
{"Input":"but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,","Output":"that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne"}
{"Input":"in it than as a friend, which she very much feared","Output":"her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,"}
{"Input":"able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my","Output":"own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance"}
{"Input":"own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,","Output":"but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister"}
{"Input":"to be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence","Output":"of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name"}
{"Input":"The tenderest caresses followed this confession.","Output":"In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had"}
{"Input":"as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,","Output":"and established as a fact, which no partiality could"}
{"Input":"He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his","Output":"embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye"}
{"Input":"He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging","Output":"Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore"}
{"Input":"my ease among strangers of gentility!\"","Output":"\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention"}
{"Input":"to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.","Output":"They were engaged about the end of that time to attend"}

{"Input":"But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them","Output":"away from her?\""}
{"Input":"One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own.","Output":"To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,"}
{"Input":"would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,","Output":"cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,"}
{"Input":"dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison","Output":"it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own."}
{"Input":"travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely","Output":"less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress"}
{"Input":"at different times could produce,--with tenderness,","Output":"pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments"}
{"Input":"His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever","Output":"drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying"}
{"Input":"Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.","Output":"Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,"}
{"Input":"I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.\"","Output":"\"I am sorry I do NOT,\" said Elinor, in great astonishment,"}
{"Input":"will ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.","Output":"Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop"}
{"Input":"\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks","Output":"which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him"}
{"Input":"replied Edward.  \"Shyness is only the effect of a sense","Output":"of inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade"}

{"Input":"a letter of business.\"","Output":"\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much,"}
{"Input":"\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.","Output":"\"No--nor many weeks.\""}
{"Input":"Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had","Output":"time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,"}
{"Input":"that she had never seen him in such spirits before","Output":"in her life."}
{"Input":"submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman","Output":"as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command"}

{"Input":"He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by","Output":"ill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe"}
{"Input":"when you left them.\"","Output":"\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long"}
{"Input":"her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her,","Output":"was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was"}
{"Input":"might be to express herself properly by letter, it was","Output":"at least preferable to giving the information by word"}
{"Input":"soon procured herself a book.","Output":"Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant"}
{"Input":"for he has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am","Output":"determined to set for it the very first opportunity.\""}
{"Input":"a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more","Output":"agreeable than her mother only in being more silent."}
{"Input":"for all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side","Output":"of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.","Output":"Elinor felt equal amazement.  For a few moments every one"}
{"Input":"and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves","Output":"and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be"}
{"Input":"that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars","Output":"would be off; and when Edward did not come near us"}
{"Input":"and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,","Output":"to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed"}
{"Input":"quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad","Output":"to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is"}

{"Input":"\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently;","Output":"\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all"}

{"Input":"pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,","Output":"so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return,","Output":"and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered,"}

{"Input":"that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing","Output":"was due to her which might make her at all less so."}
{"Input":"\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could","Output":"plainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it."}

{"Input":"\"Poor Marianne!\" said her brother to Colonel Brandon,","Output":"in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,--"}

{"Input":"It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly","Output":"would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,"}
{"Input":"\"Well, Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Jennings,","Output":"sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,"}

{"Input":"and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I,","Output":"all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used"}
{"Input":"\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"","Output":"\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion"}
{"Input":"This was gaining something, something to look forward to.","Output":"Colonel Brandon must have some information to give."}
{"Input":"Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.--","Output":"A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it"}
{"Input":"In the evening, when they were all three together,","Output":"Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--"}
{"Input":"His demands and your inexperience together, on a small,","Output":"very small income, must have brought on distresses which"}

{"Input":"should go when he left them--but still, go he must.","Output":"Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly"}
{"Input":"with the same impatient wonder.  He rose from his seat,","Output":"and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing"}
{"Input":"that if he were to enter into any profession with a view","Output":"of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent"}
{"Input":"of incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she","Output":"wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,"}
{"Input":"could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,","Output":"and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long"}
{"Input":"She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses,","Output":"her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the"}

{"Input":"the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,","Output":"I should never have known he DID like it better than"}
{"Input":"this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  Willing therefore","Output":"to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her"}

{"Input":"from her for a few months, I should very soon have","Output":"outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing"}
{"Input":"assurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele","Output":"was made completely happy."}
{"Input":"and she exclaimed;--","Output":"\"Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be"}
{"Input":"stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,","Output":"in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is"}
{"Input":"They recommended the army.  That was a great deal","Output":"too smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel"}
{"Input":"looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--","Output":"\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs."}
{"Input":"\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often","Output":"understood.  But SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this,"}
{"Input":"Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable","Output":"to believe it."}
{"Input":"It so happened that while her two sisters with","Output":"Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,"}

{"Input":"and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.","Output":"Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's"}
{"Input":"that took place under our roof yesterday.\"","Output":"They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful"}
{"Input":"Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours","Output":"of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,"}
{"Input":"could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late.\"","Output":"\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\""}
{"Input":"\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any","Output":"part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess"}
{"Input":"I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,","Output":"you may depend upon it.\""}
{"Input":"for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her","Output":"from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation,"}

{"Input":"after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged","Output":"him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,"}
{"Input":"somebody that is in orders already.\"","Output":"\"My dear ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--"}
{"Input":"by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton,","Output":"she found her one of the most charming women in the world!"}

{"Input":"or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy","Output":"of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours."}
{"Input":"herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,","Output":"without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened"}

{"Input":"affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they","Output":"were together."}
{"Input":"\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.","Output":"He made her no answer; and only observed, after again"}

{"Input":"\"He would certainly have done more justice to","Output":"simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;"}
{"Input":"and could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too","Output":"I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,"}

{"Input":"the cause of disappointing the party; but at the same","Output":"time declared it to be unavoidable."}

{"Input":"I may be spared.\"","Output":"\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness,"}
{"Input":"which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized","Output":"for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner"}
{"Input":"Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne","Output":"to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours"}
{"Input":"has her own way.\"","Output":"\"And now,\" silently conjectured Elinor, \"she will"}

{"Input":"\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he","Output":"knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down"}
{"Input":"which might otherwise have waited the effect of time","Output":"and judgment."}
{"Input":"in the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is","Output":"still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I shall keep"}

{"Input":"almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day","Output":"was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his"}

{"Input":"of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but","Output":"the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have"}

{"Input":"\"Certainly not.\"","Output":"\"I am sorry for that,\" returned the other,"}

{"Input":"equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor,","Output":"in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy,"}
{"Input":"and then covering her face with her handkerchief,","Output":"almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,"}
{"Input":"ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.","Output":"You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,"}
{"Input":"she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,","Output":"and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,"}
{"Input":"to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could","Output":"not give offence.  His kindness was not confined to words;"}
{"Input":"in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.","Output":"He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;"}
{"Input":"for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,","Output":"only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress"}
{"Input":"from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness","Output":"and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;"}
{"Input":"which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which","Output":"on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid."}
{"Input":"between the door and the window, as to make it hardly","Output":"possible to speak at one without being heard at the other."}
{"Input":"and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high","Output":"spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined"}
{"Input":"However small Elinor's general dependence on","Output":"Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her"}
{"Input":"exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,","Output":"of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance."}
{"Input":"instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele,","Output":"and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole"}
{"Input":"\"He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us.  I WILL be","Output":"calm; I WILL be mistress of myself.\""}
{"Input":"Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"","Output":"\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a"}

{"Input":"that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'","Output":"I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,"}
{"Input":"Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there","Output":"cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always"}
{"Input":"and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than","Output":"his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased."}
{"Input":"but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,","Output":"were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy."}
{"Input":"What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,","Output":"that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not"}
{"Input":"her friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,","Output":"and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen"}
{"Input":"and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;","Output":"and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be"}

{"Input":"and openly assure her of an affection which I had already","Output":"taken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the"}

{"Input":"could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation","Output":"which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes"}

{"Input":"became uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations","Output":"whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself."}
{"Input":"dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound","Output":"Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,"}

{"Input":"rather than the present, she avoided every appearance","Output":"of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she"}
{"Input":"must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination","Output":"for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.","Output":"\"My dear friend,\" cried Lucy, as soon as they were"}
{"Input":"Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against","Output":"the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about"}
{"Input":"\"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it","Output":"is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\""}
{"Input":"I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!","Output":"(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what"}
{"Input":"and if I were you, I would not give him up to my","Output":"younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills."}

{"Input":"     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was","Output":"     another's.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,"}
{"Input":"Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it","Output":"in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend."}

{"Input":"though it was what she had rather expected all along;","Output":"so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation"}
{"Input":"discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor's particular knowledge","Output":"of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, a little--not much.\"","Output":"After a short pause.  \"You have no confidence"}

{"Input":"Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so,","Output":"because satisfied that none founded on an impartial"}

{"Input":"immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague report had","Output":"reached her before of my attachment to some young lady"}

{"Input":"if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may","Output":"think about building.  These parlors are both too small"}
{"Input":"Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share","Output":"in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling"}
{"Input":"Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,","Output":"without waiting for her assent, continued,"}

{"Input":"and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,","Output":"while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready"}
{"Input":"as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up","Output":"on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,"}
{"Input":"The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose","Output":"in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,"}

{"Input":"Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving","Output":"such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately"}
{"Input":"He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know","Output":"who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from"}
{"Input":"He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed","Output":"painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment."}
{"Input":"insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough","Output":"to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have"}
{"Input":"Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she","Output":"humoured her children; and these were their only resources."}
{"Input":"of nobody but me!--No pride, no hauteur, and your sister","Output":"just the same--all sweetness and affability!\""}

{"Input":"I wonder what I should do with it!\"","Output":"Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point."}
{"Input":"you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they","Output":"are such favourites with Harry!\""}
{"Input":"Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?","Output":"Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?\""}
{"Input":"entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect","Output":"on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all"}
{"Input":"\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him","Output":"as to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,"}
{"Input":"might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,","Output":"good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would"}
{"Input":"His visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at","Output":"an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;"}

{"Input":"the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;","Output":"but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then"}
{"Input":"in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,","Output":"always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\""}
{"Input":"and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy","Output":"unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her,"}
{"Input":"and their children, the old Gentleman's days were","Output":"comfortably spent.  His attachment to them all increased."}
{"Input":"I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.","Output":"Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing"}
{"Input":"When is it to take place?\"","Output":"\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\""}
{"Input":"and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--","Output":"\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no"}
{"Input":"Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,","Output":"seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained"}
{"Input":"of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds","Output":"on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune"}
{"Input":"When the particulars of this conversation were repeated","Output":"by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,"}
{"Input":"a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.\"","Output":"Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated"}
{"Input":"\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,","Output":"I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\""}
{"Input":"liberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.","Output":"I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,"}

{"Input":"as plainly denoted how well she understood him.","Output":"\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at"}

{"Input":"\"There now,\" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering,","Output":"\"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I"}
{"Input":"Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.","Output":"She knew her sister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a"}
{"Input":"The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married;","Output":"and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger"}
{"Input":"supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;","Output":"supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise"}
{"Input":"which her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,","Output":"she exclaimed--"}
{"Input":"\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great","Output":"liberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this."}
{"Input":"she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,","Output":"with revived security of Edward's honour and love,"}
{"Input":"his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.","Output":"The horses arrived, even before they were expected,"}
{"Input":"     on me.","Output":"     \"I am, dear Madam,"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take","Output":"some revenge on her, \"you think young men never stand"}

{"Input":"\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,","Output":"always in the habit of associating with people of better"}

{"Input":"alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,","Output":"was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness"}
{"Input":"She took them all most affectionately by the hand,","Output":"and expressed great delight in seeing them again."}
{"Input":"\"Then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried Mr. Palmer.","Output":"\"My love you contradict every body,\" said his wife"}
{"Input":"     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,","Output":"     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of"}
{"Input":"His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much","Output":"of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,"}
{"Input":"the night before of calling on her while they were absent,","Output":"was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home."}
{"Input":"Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.","Output":"The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,"}
{"Input":"as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--","Output":"the last manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid"}
{"Input":"and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,","Output":"must be before her, must force her attention, and engross"}
{"Input":"strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.","Output":"Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there"}
{"Input":"\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little","Output":"Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the"}
{"Input":"were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,","Output":"and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned"}
{"Input":"deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her","Output":"betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,"}
{"Input":"\"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.","Output":"I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better"}
{"Input":"not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?\"","Output":"\"No,\" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed"}

{"Input":"did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself","Output":"leading to the fact."}
{"Input":"how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear","Output":"of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on"}
{"Input":"prevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,","Output":"she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far"}
{"Input":"justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,","Output":"and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still,"}
{"Input":"because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.","Output":"May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,"}
{"Input":"said he, \"the consequence of ignorance of the world--","Output":"and want of employment.  Had my brother given me"}
{"Input":"her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not","Output":"prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,"}

{"Input":"I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness","Output":"is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull"}
{"Input":"Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a","Output":"way so satisfactory to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings"}

{"Input":"His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.","Output":"They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical"}
{"Input":"Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;","Output":"she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,"}
{"Input":"as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;","Output":"and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,"}
{"Input":"I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be","Output":"thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth"}
{"Input":"a thing in agitation.  He has a most excellent mother.","Output":"Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,"}

{"Input":"and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss","Output":"Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it;"}
{"Input":"Elinor found, when the evening was over,","Output":"that disposition is not materially altered by a change"}
{"Input":"variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.","Output":"\"Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning,"}

{"Input":"hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the","Output":"falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;"}
{"Input":"internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose","Output":"whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she"}

{"Input":"to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the","Output":"Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss"}

{"Input":"Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at","Output":"least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most"}
{"Input":"more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were","Output":"the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,"}
{"Input":"Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,","Output":"giving way to feelings which I had always been too much"}
{"Input":"exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;","Output":"it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep"}

{"Input":"how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am","Output":"sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;"}
{"Input":"\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,","Output":"one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,"}

{"Input":"\"What a pity it is, Elinor,\" said Marianne,","Output":"\"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\""}
{"Input":"\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,","Output":"no longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest"}
{"Input":"warm and his temper affectionate.","Output":"No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love"}

{"Input":"\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I","Output":"have nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly.\""}
{"Input":"\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.","Output":"\"No, ma'am, for my mistress.\""}

{"Input":"You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.","Output":"Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments"}
{"Input":"with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity","Output":"for observations, which, with a most important face,"}
{"Input":"as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw","Output":"her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping"}

{"Input":"comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry","Output":"concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side,"}

{"Input":"They have brought the whole coach full of playthings","Output":"for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?"}
{"Input":"and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness","Output":"of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,"}

{"Input":"This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,","Output":"restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,"}

{"Input":"He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,","Output":"such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;"}

{"Input":"she forced herself to begin her design by saying,","Output":"as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward Ferrars very much,"}
{"Input":"and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,","Output":"took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it"}
{"Input":"Marianne pressed her hand and replied,","Output":"\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof."}
{"Input":"comforts? no friends?  Is your loss such as leaves","Output":"no opening for consolation?  Much as you suffer now,"}

{"Input":"to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.","Output":"Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing,"}
{"Input":"His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once","Output":"announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this,"}

{"Input":"It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,","Output":"and the flower-garden will slope down just before it,"}
{"Input":"the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,","Output":"unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,"}
{"Input":"abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite","Output":"of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration"}
{"Input":"\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"","Output":"\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been;"}
{"Input":"Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her","Output":"husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day"}
{"Input":"that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this","Output":"was the end of it!\""}

{"Input":"Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure,","Output":"who, though attending and nursing her the whole day,"}

{"Input":"without any diminution of her usual cordiality.--","Output":"These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt"}

{"Input":"Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine","Output":"of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but"}

{"Input":"His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,","Output":"and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible."}
{"Input":"In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;","Output":"but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more"}

{"Input":"\"You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost","Output":"to you than she is now.\""}
{"Input":"Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of","Output":"the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that.\""}

{"Input":"So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion","Output":"varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming"}
{"Input":"Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself","Output":"in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;"}

{"Input":"The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose","Output":"immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;"}
{"Input":"Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that","Output":"little had seen so much variety in his address to her"}

{"Input":"\"I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever","Output":"heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say"}
{"Input":"she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,","Output":"entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,"}
{"Input":"Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor,","Output":"satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid"}
{"Input":"that can be shewn Marianne.  MY gratitude will be insured","Output":"immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS"}

{"Input":"great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.  She was full","Output":"of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said"}

{"Input":"of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from","Output":"his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more."}
{"Input":"Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know,","Output":"Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear."}
{"Input":"that I was called away to the relief of one whom he","Output":"had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it,"}

{"Input":"But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged","Output":"by me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;"}
{"Input":"gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--","Output":"She was carried out of the room therefore in her"}
{"Input":"and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,","Output":"invited her to come in."}
{"Input":"She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own","Output":"feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,"}

{"Input":"\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,","Output":"in the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,"}

{"Input":"\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of","Output":"nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you"}
{"Input":"into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not","Output":"sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,"}
{"Input":"would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts","Output":"of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,"}
{"Input":"his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;","Output":"and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that"}
{"Input":"to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--","Output":"But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,"}
{"Input":"Elinor could not help smiling at this display of","Output":"indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she"}
{"Input":"Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,","Output":"to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my"}

{"Input":"     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more","Output":"     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand"}
{"Input":"pretty girl.","Output":"The immediate advantage to herself was by no means"}
{"Input":"She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her","Output":"determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all"}
{"Input":"After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her","Output":"sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her"}
{"Input":"and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having","Output":"took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs."}
{"Input":"said Miss Steele.  \"I am sorry she is not well--\"","Output":"for Marianne had left the room on their arrival."}
{"Input":"to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character","Output":"farther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship"}
{"Input":"perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her","Output":"forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,"}
{"Input":"but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly","Output":"delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on"}
{"Input":"and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might","Output":"be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,"}
{"Input":"will do you good.\"","Output":"Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination"}
{"Input":"of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.","Output":"He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging"}
{"Input":"\"No--nor many weeks.\"","Output":"Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;"}
{"Input":"lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,","Output":"in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her."}
{"Input":"from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,","Output":"and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,"}
{"Input":"Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,","Output":"considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,"}
{"Input":"and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.","Output":"Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then"}
{"Input":"Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with","Output":"yet greater eagerness."}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!\"","Output":"\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare."}
{"Input":"of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,","Output":"and resolved against ever admitting consolation"}
{"Input":"interference be borne.\"","Output":"She determined, after some consideration, that if"}

{"Input":"and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.","Output":"I understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you"}
{"Input":"to old superannuated servants by my father's will,","Output":"and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it."}
{"Input":"rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--","Output":"or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards"}
{"Input":"too smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel","Output":"enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,"}

{"Input":"but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did","Output":"not go at all."}
{"Input":"especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,","Output":"is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,"}
{"Input":"so justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,","Output":"though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which"}
{"Input":"what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,","Output":"for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing"}
{"Input":"\"I hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;","Output":"and with a forced smile presently added, \"It is I who may"}

{"Input":"that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned","Output":"the partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of"}
{"Input":"from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding","Output":"Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,"}
{"Input":"he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.","Output":"As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his"}
{"Input":"much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason","Output":"and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,"}
{"Input":"Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this","Output":"civil triumph, by the door's being thrown open, the servant's"}
{"Input":"when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.","Output":"His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,"}
{"Input":"conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion","Output":"to which he had limited the performance of his promise to"}
{"Input":"relationship!--no connection between them!--and now","Output":"that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?\""}
{"Input":"I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.","Output":"It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,"}
{"Input":"And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,","Output":"that when she joined them at dinner only two hours"}
{"Input":"had injured her, how much more had he injured himself;","Output":"if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless."}
{"Input":"shall be, when I come back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape","Output":"at one another as dull as two cats.\""}
{"Input":"of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,","Output":"for a short time made her feel only for herself;"}

{"Input":"in general, she proportioned them to the number of","Output":"her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,"}
{"Input":"was all that remained for his widow and daughters.","Output":"His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,"}
{"Input":"The old well-established grievance of duty against will,","Output":"parent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have"}
{"Input":"sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.","Output":"In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless"}
{"Input":"of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,","Output":"which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her household"}
{"Input":"especially as it will most likely be some time--it","Output":"is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure"}
{"Input":"should suspect what was the matter; but it made him","Output":"so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a"}
{"Input":"The deception could not continue after this;","Output":"and an explanation immediately took place, by which both"}
{"Input":"\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.","Output":"Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance"}

{"Input":"of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.","Output":"But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy"}
{"Input":"which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised","Output":"with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,"}
{"Input":"I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,","Output":"before he married, as he was so rich?\""}
{"Input":"I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better","Output":"acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature"}
{"Input":"But she could hear of no situation that at once answered","Output":"her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence"}
{"Input":"thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom","Output":"it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever,"}
{"Input":"absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent","Output":"to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,"}
{"Input":"of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told","Output":"to consider it, and certainty itself.  She now found, that"}
{"Input":"He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's,","Output":"and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his"}
{"Input":"agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.","Output":"Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such"}
{"Input":"eyes at times, which I did not like.\"","Output":"Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,"}
{"Input":"sitting room.","Output":"In such employments as these they were interrupted"}
{"Input":"interesting to them all.  As this silence continued,","Output":"every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible"}
{"Input":"future consideration, which a conscientious woman would","Output":"not disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;"}
{"Input":"feelings especially, which required some trouble and time","Output":"to subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,"}
{"Input":"by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too","Output":"great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a"}

{"Input":"\"Colonel Brandon!\"","Output":"\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,"}
{"Input":"\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate","Output":"girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion"}
{"Input":"you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.","Output":"Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be"}

{"Input":"any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it immediately","Output":"struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby;"}
{"Input":"proud woman.\"","Output":"\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;"}
{"Input":"cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!","Output":"Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,"}
{"Input":"with her usual noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad","Output":"to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your"}
{"Input":"In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had","Output":"no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise"}
{"Input":"repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand","Output":"what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any"}
{"Input":"to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support","Output":"which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved."}
{"Input":"do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,","Output":"I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do"}
{"Input":"Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a","Output":"curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know"}
{"Input":"\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,","Output":"I am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face."}
{"Input":"I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,","Output":"you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they"}
{"Input":"likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings","Output":"interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away"}
{"Input":"What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,","Output":"since it can advance him so little towards what must"}
{"Input":"felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this","Output":"hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak"}
{"Input":"a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof","Output":"would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe"}
{"Input":"     \"I cannot express my disappointment in having","Output":"     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment"}
{"Input":"mother would have approved.","Output":"Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the"}

{"Input":"seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort","Output":"to be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much"}
{"Input":"and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.","Output":"What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could"}

{"Input":"for your general character, and his particular approbation","Output":"of your behaviour on the present occasion.\""}

{"Input":"a much greater willingness to make mean concessions","Output":"by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,"}
{"Input":"what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened","Output":"too in her opinion as well as in yours.  You tell me that"}
{"Input":"to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.","Output":"\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\""}
{"Input":"great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\"--","Output":"Elinor made what excuse she could for her."}
{"Input":"and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the","Output":"house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,"}
{"Input":"\"I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you;","Output":"for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,"}
{"Input":"to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,","Output":"that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it"}
{"Input":"in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment","Output":"of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,"}
{"Input":"was attending her daughter.  And now to be so rewarded!","Output":"'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her"}
{"Input":"Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss","Output":"Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,"}
{"Input":"Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection","Output":"with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;"}

{"Input":"of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,","Output":"he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an"}
{"Input":"her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;","Output":"and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company"}
{"Input":"Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,","Output":"situated on a sloping lawn.  It had no park, but the"}
{"Input":"This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions","Output":"to Edward.  \"And who is Willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice,"}
{"Input":"in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings","Output":"and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits,"}
{"Input":"\"No, indeed, it is not.\"","Output":"\"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I"}
{"Input":"been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must","Output":"it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,"}
{"Input":"formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer","Output":"for the last ten years.  They contained a noble piece"}
{"Input":"object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood,","Output":"by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she"}
{"Input":"seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,","Output":"of all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression"}
{"Input":"her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,","Output":"but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,"}
{"Input":"They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn","Output":"whether her sons were to be of the party.  The expectation"}
{"Input":"of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested","Output":"in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's"}
{"Input":"from the park to the cottage--\"but pray, are you","Output":"personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother,"}
{"Input":"Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"","Output":"This however was more than she could believe herself;"}
{"Input":"Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully","Output":"was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,"}
{"Input":"communication which strong family affection would","Output":"naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness"}
{"Input":"Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.","Output":"Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her"}
{"Input":"We must wait, it may be for many years.  With almost every","Output":"other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;"}
{"Input":"happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?\"","Output":"Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,"}
{"Input":"I have been trying to do it away.\"","Output":"The tenderest caresses followed this confession."}
{"Input":"and after expressing it with earnestness, he added,","Output":"in the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is"}
{"Input":"reasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people","Output":"the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged"}
{"Input":"\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking","Output":"the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was"}
{"Input":"A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,","Output":"concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his"}
{"Input":"of time upon her health.","Output":"Margaret returned, and the family were again all"}
{"Input":"before I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket","Output":"and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor."}
{"Input":"\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you","Output":"very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with"}
{"Input":"Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him","Output":"with the same impatient wonder.  He rose from his seat,"}
{"Input":"would be so trifling in comparison with their own,","Output":"she should have any handsome article of furniture."}
{"Input":"Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried","Output":"to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence."}
{"Input":"Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven","Output":"that SHE had never made so rude a speech."}
{"Input":"instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly","Output":"by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must"}
{"Input":"\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"","Output":"\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying","Output":"such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to."}

{"Input":"Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.","Output":"For many years of her life she had had two sons;"}
{"Input":"the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached","Output":"is too much for an indifferent person.\""}
{"Input":"and so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit","Output":"that he should be living about at his own charge now,"}
{"Input":"it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single.\"","Output":"Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that"}
{"Input":"Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred","Output":"to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it"}

{"Input":"to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,","Output":"had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister."}
{"Input":"that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to","Output":"return the same good will, than the power of expressing it."}
{"Input":"of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it","Output":"is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body."}
{"Input":"and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,","Output":"by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite"}

{"Input":"admitted them into it.","Output":"As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable"}

{"Input":"had nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she","Output":"was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore"}
{"Input":"embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned","Output":"every thing delightful to her as it chose."}
{"Input":"or no farther curiosity on its subject.  I will","Output":"not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\""}

{"Input":"cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,","Output":"and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both"}

{"Input":"Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it","Output":"ended in an absence of mind still more settled."}
{"Input":"but Marianne excused herself from being of the party,","Output":"under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,"}
{"Input":"It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,","Output":"and that every body should be extremely merry all day long."}
{"Input":"Your business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,","Output":"forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\""}
{"Input":"But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--","Output":"Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing"}

{"Input":"\"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?\" asked Elinor.","Output":"\"Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he"}
{"Input":"Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption","Output":"from the others, she would have described every room"}
{"Input":"and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,","Output":"the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he"}
{"Input":"his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as","Output":"words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb"}
{"Input":"one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read","Output":"its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence."}

{"Input":"his nature capable of such cruelty.  This woman of whom he","Output":"writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own"}
{"Input":"provoked her immediately to say with warmth,","Output":"\"This is admiration of a very particular kind!--"}
{"Input":"old disputes.\"","Output":"\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it"}
{"Input":"\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no","Output":"relationship!--no connection between them!--and now"}
{"Input":"I am sure.\"","Output":"\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed"}
{"Input":"any thing she had ever felt before.  She was mortified,","Output":"shocked, confounded."}
{"Input":"reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think","Output":"about it herself, you know, it was no business of other"}
{"Input":"offending every moment of our lives.  I value not her","Output":"censure any more than I should do her commendation."}
{"Input":"you have too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon","Output":"must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on"}
{"Input":"\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,","Output":"\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well."}
{"Input":"Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned","Output":"her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks,"}
{"Input":"determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John)","Output":"that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance"}

{"Input":"had left her for a fortnight without any; and now,","Output":"by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again."}
{"Input":"and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest","Output":"of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,"}
{"Input":"expects you; so you cannot refuse to come.\"","Output":"They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation."}
{"Input":"\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"","Output":"\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,\" said Elinor;"}
{"Input":"and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my","Output":"life, as when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.--"}
{"Input":"Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.","Output":"Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable"}
{"Input":"\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these","Output":"bottoms must be dirty in winter.\""}
{"Input":"on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\"--","Output":"hesitatingly it was said.--\"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk"}
{"Input":"Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear","Output":"Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;"}
{"Input":"know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach","Output":"his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say."}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come","Output":"to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth"}
{"Input":"intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited","Output":"in the morning, dined with them.  The former left them"}
{"Input":"to Marianne.  Nothing could do away the knowledge","Output":"of what the latter had suffered through his means,"}
{"Input":"as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him","Output":"on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest."}
{"Input":"he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--","Output":"such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived"}
{"Input":"in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.","Output":"Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation"}
{"Input":"and in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\"","Output":"\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him,"}
{"Input":"and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which","Output":"might feed her powers of reflection some time, though she"}
{"Input":"be the smallest difference in the world between them;","Output":"and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,"}
{"Input":"of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.","Output":"The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,"}

{"Input":"\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"","Output":"\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\""}
{"Input":"If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself,","Output":"his difficulties from his mother had seemed great,"}
{"Input":"With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance","Output":"gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,"}
{"Input":"Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.","Output":"He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,"}
{"Input":"she immediately said,","Output":"\"They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?\" But then again,"}
{"Input":"I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes","Output":"I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him."}
{"Input":"of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted","Output":"her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her,"}
{"Input":"minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,","Output":"when Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not"}
{"Input":"The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss","Output":"Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours"}
{"Input":"This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his","Output":"intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he"}
{"Input":"Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing","Output":"him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year."}
{"Input":"would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe","Output":"they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure"}
{"Input":"too--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little","Output":"of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see"}
{"Input":"aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary","Output":"it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication"}
{"Input":"and hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"","Output":"Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing"}
{"Input":"considered the existence of each, under such a blow,","Output":"with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable,"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen","Output":"to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,"}
{"Input":"\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being","Output":"so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing"}
{"Input":"but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he","Output":"really felt.  Again they all sat down, and for a moment"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I","Output":"heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it"}
{"Input":"occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.","Output":"No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected"}
{"Input":"In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter,","Output":"on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,"}
{"Input":"Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity","Output":"carries you too far.\""}
{"Input":"\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would","Output":"be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,"}

{"Input":"When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected","Output":"that there was a lady at the other end of the street"}
{"Input":"But I shall see them tomorrow.\"","Output":"\"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution"}

{"Input":"I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till","Output":"I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go"}
{"Input":"\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,","Output":"\"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  I could"}
{"Input":"becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spoke","Output":"with calmness."}
{"Input":"After a short silence which succeeded the first","Output":"surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked"}
{"Input":"\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain","Output":"on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\"--"}
{"Input":"The two mothers, though each really convinced that","Output":"her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour"}
{"Input":"in England.\"","Output":"\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,"}
{"Input":"and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength","Output":"and urgency which illness could command, the interest"}
{"Input":"been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven","Output":"knows what I should have done without your friendship.\"--"}
{"Input":"selfish parents.","Output":"\"What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?\""}
{"Input":"whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish","Output":"her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout"}
{"Input":"\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you","Output":"know more of him.\""}
{"Input":"Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,","Output":"on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too"}
{"Input":"equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat","Output":"deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,"}
{"Input":"give her neither spirits nor language.","Output":"But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From"}
{"Input":"her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage,","Output":"and she looked forward with hope to what a few months"}

{"Input":"\"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you","Output":"will like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,"}
{"Input":"\"I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it","Output":"is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!\""}
{"Input":"leaving the house, she was again called down stairs","Output":"by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her"}
{"Input":"and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect","Output":"of time upon her health."}
{"Input":"I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics","Output":"of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily they were all"}
{"Input":"and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and","Output":"Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous."}
{"Input":"that she wept with agony through the whole of it.","Output":"All her impatience to be at home again now returned;"}
{"Input":"as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--","Output":"has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's"}
{"Input":"and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.","Output":"Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval"}
{"Input":"which belonging to the university would have given me;","Output":"for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen."}
{"Input":"and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,","Output":"which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange"}
{"Input":"be increased by noise.","Output":"Marianne, to the surprise of her sister,"}
{"Input":"to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness","Output":"in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight"}
{"Input":"they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock","Output":"of her hair.\""}
{"Input":"eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make","Output":"the dear little love some amends for her disappointment"}
{"Input":"emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.","Output":"Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,"}
{"Input":"and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened","Output":"a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full"}
{"Input":"and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,","Output":"sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,"}
{"Input":"doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever","Output":"be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby"}
{"Input":"equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--","Output":"\"There is no use in staying here; I must be off.\""}

{"Input":"Mrs. Ferrars?\"","Output":"Elinor DID think the question a very odd one,"}
{"Input":"shocking affair.","Output":"In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered"}
{"Input":"I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always","Output":"doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,"}

{"Input":"and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,","Output":"at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her"}
{"Input":"Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal,","Output":"was more positive.  She had no such object for her lingering"}
{"Input":"said Edward.--\"For worlds would not I have had a letter","Output":"of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it"}
{"Input":"sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair.","Output":"I could not have stood it.  For where she DOES dislike,"}
{"Input":"but it could not alter her design; and their mother's","Output":"concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative"}
{"Input":"and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion;","Output":"for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would","Output":"be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make"}
{"Input":"\"What? have you met him to--\"","Output":"\"I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed"}

{"Input":"and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient","Output":"for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present."}
{"Input":"A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was","Output":"enough to over-set me.\""}
{"Input":"After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became","Output":"more thoughtful and silent than he had been before,"}
{"Input":"only her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"","Output":"\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to"}

{"Input":"every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,","Output":"the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\""}
{"Input":"In about half an hour her mother returned, and though","Output":"her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful."}
{"Input":"Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was","Output":"all in a fright at his sister's audacity.  Elinor was"}
{"Input":"this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,","Output":"requires a very particular excuse.--What is it,"}
{"Input":"dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.","Output":"\"Oh, if that's all,\" cried Miss Steele, \"we can"}
{"Input":"from something more than merely malice against herself;","Output":"and might be brought, by time and address, to do"}
{"Input":"but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did","Output":"not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings"}
{"Input":"about two years afterwards, of her divorce.  It was","Output":"THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection"}
{"Input":"\"Do you know where they came from?\"","Output":"\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--"}
{"Input":"had the care of her brother, might not have done much,","Output":"however, towards procuring them seats at her table;"}
{"Input":"next morning the latter communicated a piece of news","Output":"to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew"}

{"Input":"When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne,","Output":"she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet"}
{"Input":"curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,","Output":"and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way."}
{"Input":"out from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,","Output":"on the road.  For the convenience of Charlotte and her child,"}
{"Input":"He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,","Output":"has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him"}
{"Input":"or indolent.","Output":"\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?\""}
{"Input":"But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil","Output":"seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne"}
{"Input":"in the world; the most scrupulous in performing","Output":"every engagement, however minute, and however it"}
