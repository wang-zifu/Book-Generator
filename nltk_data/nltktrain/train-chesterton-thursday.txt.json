{"Input":"\"I am not a madman,\" reiterated Gregory, with a frightful sincerity","Output":"which for a moment staggered the room, \"but I give you a counsel"}
{"Input":"if one of the guns had gone off.","Output":"\"Comrades!\" he cried, in a voice that made every man jump out of"}
{"Input":"The Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick, and","Output":"he did not answer at all."}
{"Input":"Far out of fish-shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things;","Output":"And the Green Carnation withered, as in forest fires that pass,"}

{"Input":"\"Would it not be better,\" he said a little sharply, \"to discuss","Output":"further the details of our project, now that the spy has left us?\""}

{"Input":"\"So it is,\" said Mr. Syme.","Output":"\"Nonsense!\" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else"}
{"Input":"Marquis's sudden madness of battle--the Paris train was in sight.","Output":"But the Marquis's morbid energy over-reached itself. Twice Syme,"}
{"Input":"\"Well, his house ought to be hell!\" said the Secretary; \"and if","Output":"it is hell, I'm going in!\" and he sprang over the tall railings"}
{"Input":"curse you (though I might) for being kind. I curse you for being","Output":"safe! You sit in your chairs of stone, and have never come down"}

{"Input":"under the shadow of its brim the short-sighted face and shaky","Output":"shoulders of Professor de Worms. He let himself into a seat with"}
{"Input":"Both combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats, and","Output":"stood sword in hand. The seconds stood on each side of the line"}

{"Input":"\"Look!\" cried out Bull clamorously, \"the balloon is coming down!\"","Output":"There was no need to cry out to Syme, who had never taken his eyes"}
{"Input":"drunk more champagne than was good for me, and in a flash of folly","Output":"I decided to see the situation through. Consequently it was to meet"}
{"Input":"while the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down","Output":"upon this imbecile scene."}
{"Input":"irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings.","Output":"\"Well, comrade,\" said the man with the papers after a pause, \"I"}

{"Input":"lifted his lion's voice. 'Why, then, dress up as an anarchist, you","Output":"fool!' he roared so that the room shook. 'Nobody will ever expect"}
{"Input":"tentative inquiry, when the old Professor opposite suddenly and","Output":"simply cut him short. Before Syme could ask the first diplomatic"}

{"Input":"Syme received the remark with stolidity, imagining it to be a joke.","Output":"Accepting the vein of humour, he said, with a well-bred"}
{"Input":"much discipline. You have not a moment to waste.\"","Output":"Almost as he spoke, the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white"}
{"Input":"regretted it. I preached blood and murder to those women day and","Output":"night, and--by God!--they would let me wheel their perambulators.\""}
{"Input":"some incredible accident, there were here tonight a man who all his","Output":"life had thus immensely misunderstood us, I would put this question"}
{"Input":"will say, 'The celebrated Mr. Syme, I presume.' He will say in the","Output":"most exquisite French, 'How are you?' I shall reply in the most"}
{"Input":"Syme was shabby in those days. He wore an old-fashioned black","Output":"chimney-pot hat; he was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak,"}
{"Input":"faster, so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer","Output":"but the pursued. But even at that great distance they could see"}
{"Input":"understand, your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced.\"","Output":"Syme struck the table with a radiant face."}
{"Input":"The town was mostly in shadow, but the sun had not sunk; wherever","Output":"its level light could break through, it painted everything a"}
{"Input":"George would not even be grotesque. So this inhuman landscape was","Output":"only imaginative by the presence of a man really human. To Syme's"}
{"Input":"\"Comrades,\" said the President, suddenly rising, \"we have spun out","Output":"this farce long enough. I have called you down here to tell you"}

{"Input":"materialism. His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance. The","Output":"strong, white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp"}
{"Input":"The other retorted, \"You are a dead man.\"","Output":"Syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair, and his eyes were"}
{"Input":"The man once known as Gogol said nothing, but the movements of his","Output":"hands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed"}
{"Input":"\"It is you who are unpoetical,\" replied the poet Syme. \"If what you","Output":"say of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry."}
{"Input":"\"Have you any idea,\" he asked, with a sort of benevolent","Output":"bewilderment, \"exactly where you are going?\""}

{"Input":"\"No, I don't,\" he said; \"but I suppose that if you were serious","Output":"about your anarchism, that is exactly what you would do.\""}
{"Input":"transparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it","Output":"covered up the sun like something too good to be seen. The whole"}
{"Input":"went out together into the dark streets by the docks.","Output":"Most of the snow was melted or trampled to mud, but here and there"}
{"Input":"Syme looked up at the wall, and saw a crudely-painted and pathetic","Output":"religious picture. Then he said--"}
{"Input":"with his instinct of daintiness.","Output":"\"Everyone is,\" said Ratcliffe."}
{"Input":"protoplasm, and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin","Output":"forests. The Professor says he is like a changing landscape. This"}
{"Input":"such as it was it froze him to the bone. If the last words of the","Output":"President meant anything, they meant that he had not after all"}
{"Input":"came after it (if the phrase be permissible of a cab) like panting","Output":"hounds. Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows."}
{"Input":"large loose hand like a flap to his ear.","Output":"\"I am not in the British police,\" said Syme with insane calm."}
{"Input":"honour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said.\"","Output":"\"In what I said?\""}
{"Input":"trees, and a woman had just stopped singing. On Syme's heated head","Output":"the bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that"}
{"Input":"modern meanness to which Syme could not sink even in his extreme","Output":"morbidity. Like any man, he was coward enough to fear great force;"}
{"Input":"seemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of their pursuers.","Output":"The fancy tinted Syme's overwhelming sense of wonder. Was he"}
{"Input":"would understand him when they had understood the stars. He","Output":"wondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill."}
{"Input":"\"I tell you I've seen him!\" said Dr. Bull, with thick emphasis.","Output":"\"Whom?\" asked Syme quickly. \"Not the President?\""}
{"Input":"why he has got hold of all the communications; and that is why the","Output":"last four champions of the anti-anarchist police force are running"}
{"Input":"\"Judas before Herod!\" he said, and struck the Colonel down upon","Output":"the stones. Then he turned to the Secretary, whose frightful mouth"}
{"Input":"difficult part of Thursday, has died quite suddenly. Consequently,","Output":"we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor.\""}
{"Input":"we haven't got a light on this car, if only to see by.\"","Output":"\"We have,\" said the Colonel, and from the floor of the car he"}

{"Input":"\"Oh!\" said Syme.","Output":"\"Naturally, therefore, these people talk about 'a happy time"}
{"Input":"rending all things in pieces. Energy, he said, was the All. He was","Output":"lame, shortsighted, and partially paralytic. When I met him I was"}
{"Input":"\"What can you mean by all this?\" cried Syme. \"They can't be","Output":"running the real world in that way. Surely not many working men"}

{"Input":"\"I can't take my face off here,\" replied Professor de Worms. \"It's","Output":"rather an elaborate make-up. As to whether I'm an old man, that's"}
