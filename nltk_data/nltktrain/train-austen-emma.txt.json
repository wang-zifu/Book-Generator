{"Input":"Poor little Emma!  You were very bad with the measles; that is,","Output":"you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention."}
{"Input":"The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every","Output":"thing else into the background.  An express arrived at Randalls"}
{"Input":"This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years","Output":"in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,"}

{"Input":"would stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather","Output":"than what you are all thinking of.  I will not say quite all."}
{"Input":"thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--","Output":"so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--"}
{"Input":"and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method","Output":"in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's"}
{"Input":"\"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"","Output":"\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining"}

{"Input":"merely to have his hair cut.  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him","Output":"at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to"}
{"Input":"over-throw of every thing.  A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill","Output":"to urge his nephew's instant return.  Mrs. Churchill was unwell--"}
{"Input":"Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,","Output":"was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--"}
{"Input":"before their return?\"","Output":"\"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such"}
{"Input":"especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory","Output":"brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet."}
{"Input":"A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.","Output":"But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks"}
{"Input":"He had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed","Output":"to be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.  This had"}

{"Input":"easier to you.\"","Output":"\"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind"}
{"Input":"with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty","Output":"as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you."}

{"Input":"favourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described?","Output":"Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished."}
{"Input":"but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it","Output":"may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,"}
{"Input":"of consideration.  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.","Output":"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,"}
{"Input":"\"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?\"","Output":"\"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I"}
{"Input":"\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?\"","Output":"\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,"}
{"Input":"Emma was in no danger of forgetting.  It was a commission to touch every","Output":"favourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described?"}
{"Input":"looking very deplorable.","Output":"\"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\" said Emma."}
{"Input":"\"And I do envy him, Emma.  In one respect he is the object of my envy.\"","Output":"Emma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence"}

{"Input":"\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which","Output":"pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\""}
{"Input":"she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,","Output":"and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never"}
{"Input":"entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,","Output":"and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith."}
{"Input":"\"There it is.  There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.\"--","Output":"Harriet's was--"}
{"Input":"where it ought to flow.","Output":"      The course of true love never did run smooth--"}
{"Input":"without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,","Output":"was professing himself _her_ lover.  She tried to stop him; but vainly;"}
{"Input":"though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very","Output":"rarely of use to any body.  I am sure it almost killed me once.\""}
{"Input":"but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.","Output":"He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he"}

{"Input":"plays extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly","Output":"on that point.  Oh! she is absolutely charming!  You will laugh at"}
{"Input":"There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are","Output":"to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,"}
{"Input":"she visited her friends.  But we never did.  I hardly know how it","Output":"has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side"}
{"Input":"The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer","Output":"than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied"}
{"Input":"as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--","Output":"wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss"}

{"Input":"\"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!  I never could have supposed it.","Output":"But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear."}
{"Input":"joined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,","Output":"were the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call"}
{"Input":"so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be","Output":"less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even"}
{"Input":"but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\"","Output":"Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence."}
{"Input":"\"I rather doubt that.  You are very fond of bending little minds;","Output":"but where little minds belong to rich people in authority,"}
{"Input":"neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any","Output":"thing that home affords.\""}

{"Input":"of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been","Output":"well since.  A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?"}
{"Input":"by her at dinner.  Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would","Output":"be very glad to marry him.\""}
{"Input":"and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his","Output":"care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise"}

{"Input":"Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young","Output":"woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting"}
{"Input":"You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.\"","Output":"\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston"}
{"Input":"what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very","Output":"last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I"}
{"Input":"But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.","Output":"You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--"}
{"Input":"what you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings","Output":"to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no"}
{"Input":"\"Yes,\" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\"I must say","Output":"that I have.\""}
{"Input":"she feared, would cure her.  Harriet was one of those, who,","Output":"having once begun, would be always in love.  And now, poor girl!"}
{"Input":"was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme","Output":"of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;"}
{"Input":"not meet hers.  He found he could not be useful, and his feelings","Output":"were too much irritated for talking.  That he might not be irritated"}
{"Input":"by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--","Output":"At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,"}
{"Input":"be increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.","Output":"He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,"}
{"Input":"You understand every thing.  You and Mr. Elton are one as clever","Output":"as the other.  This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,"}
{"Input":"preferable to finery.  But I am quite in the minority, I believe;","Output":"few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery"}
{"Input":"of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance","Output":"of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;"}
{"Input":"placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,","Output":"and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar"}
{"Input":"exceed by two.  I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft","Output":"air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,"}
{"Input":"you have borne with them.  The manner, perhaps, may have as little","Output":"to recommend them.  God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--"}
{"Input":"whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;","Output":"but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.\""}
{"Input":"That is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.","Output":"    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!"}
{"Input":"but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,","Output":"without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,"}
{"Input":"However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come","Output":"to talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal"}
{"Input":"\"I am concerned to hear of it.  I think they judge wisely.","Output":"But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed.  Mrs. Dixon,"}
{"Input":"and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;","Output":"but they would all be safer at home."}
{"Input":"might have had at home.\"","Output":"Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt"}

{"Input":"can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need","Output":"not think about it.\""}
{"Input":"but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.","Output":"He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.\""}
{"Input":"and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two","Output":"superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate"}
{"Input":"in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.","Output":"While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one"}
{"Input":"farther from doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness,","Output":"all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit"}
{"Input":"and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it","Output":"seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:"}
{"Input":"intelligence could do.","Output":"It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded"}
{"Input":"your notions of man's perfection.  I dare say he has; and though","Output":"it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.\""}
{"Input":"completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.","Output":"She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments."}
{"Input":"Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?  Anywhere, so that","Output":"Jane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence."}
{"Input":"to Highbury.  I have heard her every year of our lives since we","Output":"both began.  She plays charmingly.\""}
{"Input":"indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,","Output":"with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,"}
{"Input":"his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no","Output":"happier prospect!  I have heard him express himself so warmly on"}
{"Input":"undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,","Output":"and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was"}
{"Input":"The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,","Output":"I remember, he came to me quite in despair.\""}
{"Input":"on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,","Output":"I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor"}
{"Input":"in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his","Output":"voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's"}
{"Input":"Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,","Output":"she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed"}
{"Input":"thing does give you cold.  Walk home!--you are prettily shod","Output":"for walking home, I dare say.  It will be bad enough for the horses.\""}
{"Input":"meant no reflection on any body.  Miss Taylor has been used","Output":"to have two persons to please; she will now have but one."}
{"Input":"They can do nothing satisfactorily without you.\"","Output":"Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,"}
{"Input":"When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they","Output":"were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--"}
{"Input":"but will not dine alone for her.\"","Output":"Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him"}
{"Input":"They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,","Output":"and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly."}
{"Input":"compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,","Output":"under the most favourable circumstances, to require something"}
{"Input":"you walk as if you were tired.  You will not be sorry to find","Output":"yourself at home.\""}
{"Input":"before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his","Output":"being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said"}
{"Input":"of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;","Output":"and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space"}
{"Input":"\"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more","Output":"generally interesting.  My dear sir, you really are too bountiful."}
{"Input":"and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings","Output":"of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world"}
{"Input":"\"I am afraid we must be running away,\" said Emma, glancing at Harriet,","Output":"and beginning to rise--\"My father will be expecting us."}
{"Input":"it is what I would not do upon any consideration.\"","Output":"\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not"}
{"Input":"an hour it was known all over Highbury.  It was the very event","Output":"to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all"}
{"Input":"in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.","Output":"Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?"}
{"Input":"and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think","Output":"there is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the"}
{"Input":"I believe.  Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account","Output":"of things.\""}
{"Input":"like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the","Output":"world is not their's, nor the world's law.'\""}
{"Input":"According to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had","Output":"written most pressingly.  Would Jane but go, means were to be found,"}
{"Input":"we will call in Mr. Perry.  The expense shall not be thought of;","Output":"and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say"}
{"Input":"I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking","Output":"that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,"}
{"Input":"on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--","Output":"interested, without disturbing him.  He had long made up his mind to Jane"}
{"Input":"a sentiment distinct and independent.  Mrs. Weston was the object","Output":"of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem."}
{"Input":"restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'","Output":"coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,"}
{"Input":"is felt by every body.  If he would act in this sort of manner,","Output":"on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend"}
{"Input":"of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led","Output":"aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt"}
{"Input":"of it.  I thought it must be so.  I thought I could not be so deceived;","Output":"but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,"}
{"Input":"I assure you.  Do not run away with such an idea.\"","Output":"\"Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is"}
{"Input":"He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.","Output":"It was but an effusion of lively spirits."}
{"Input":"it has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,","Output":"enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,"}
{"Input":"of my _amor_ _patriae_.  Do not let me lose it.  I assure you the utmost","Output":"stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any"}
{"Input":"\"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\" said he.  \"Oftentimes","Output":"very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.  There is safety"}
{"Input":"it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.","Output":"She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,"}
{"Input":"at all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only","Output":"as parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl,"}
{"Input":"The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had","Output":"always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had"}
{"Input":"all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace","Output":"in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been"}
{"Input":"\"My first enjoyment,\" replied John Knightley, as they passed through","Output":"the sweep-gate, \"will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\""}
{"Input":"seriously of her?\"","Output":"\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn:  \"never, I assure you."}
{"Input":"to read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself.\"","Output":"\"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.  You will"}
{"Input":"\"Me!  I should be quite in the way.  But, perhaps--I may be equally","Output":"in the way here.  Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me."}
{"Input":"should like any body fixed on by you.  You provide for the family,","Output":"you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me."}
{"Input":"Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had","Output":"herself the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty,"}
{"Input":"heard of it.\"--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,","Output":"the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band"}
{"Input":"ingratitude in me to be severe on them?\"","Output":"Emma laughed, and replied:  \"But I had the assistance of all"}
{"Input":"such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we","Output":"are paying our visit?\""}
{"Input":"with the children.  We are very proud of the children, are not we,","Output":"papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\""}
{"Input":"\"Do come with me,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if it be not very disagreeable","Output":"to you.  It need not detain us long.  We will go to Hartfield afterwards."}
{"Input":"you to save yourself from greater pain.  Perhaps I may sometimes","Output":"have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather"}
{"Input":"at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--","Output":"that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could"}

{"Input":"for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the","Output":"gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded"}
{"Input":"wants strength.  It is like a woman's writing.\"","Output":"This was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him"}
{"Input":"highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.","Output":"She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking"}
{"Input":"\"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.","Output":"Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin.\""}
{"Input":"could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,","Output":"and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton"}

{"Input":"for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,","Output":"were it only for a moment.  She could not be too soon alarmed,"}
{"Input":"She never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial","Output":"and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible."}
{"Input":"thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know","Output":"very little of the matter.  He understood what would be welcome;"}
{"Input":"pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine","Output":"with them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--"}
{"Input":"objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,","Output":"the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton"}
{"Input":"To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under","Output":"temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail"}
{"Input":"Very well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--","Output":"Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma"}
{"Input":"\"I assure you she did.  She felt your full meaning.  She has talked","Output":"of it since.  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--"}
{"Input":"to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of","Output":"Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations."}
{"Input":"\"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would","Output":"give any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself."}
{"Input":"delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,","Output":"were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less."}
{"Input":"\"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\"","Output":"\"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have"}
{"Input":"that might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place","Output":"that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must"}

{"Input":"of those days.  So very good of them to send her the whole way!","Output":"But they always do, you know.  Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next."}
{"Input":"She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,","Output":"to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme."}
{"Input":"many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.","Output":"I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.\""}
{"Input":"There was no time for farther remark or explanation.  The dream must","Output":"be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round"}
{"Input":"said Frank Churchill, \"examining the capabilities of the house.","Output":"I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,"}
{"Input":"thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my","Output":"conscience tells me ought not to be.'  `Do not imagine, madam,'"}
{"Input":"to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.","Output":"She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.  She had"}
{"Input":"a considerable journey.\"","Output":"\"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.  Sixty-five miles farther"}
{"Input":"_any_ _thing_ to like to yield.  Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--","Output":"I hope you consent?\""}
{"Input":"\"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her","Output":"so very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\""}
{"Input":"\"Did you see her often at Weymouth?  Were you often in the same society?\"","Output":"At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,"}
{"Input":"herself as having any thing to complain of.  The affection of such","Output":"a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--"}
{"Input":"obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people","Output":"say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,"}
{"Input":"glad to see him so well.  Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter","Output":"this morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--"}

{"Input":"Do not let us be too solemn on the business.  He has encouragement","Output":"enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.\""}
{"Input":"regard or sympathy.  She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew","Output":"a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration."}
{"Input":"in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,","Output":"unheard by her father,"}
{"Input":"She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event","Output":"acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness"}

{"Input":"occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;","Output":"no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very","Output":"glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting"}
{"Input":"to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--","Output":"Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep"}

{"Input":"\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I","Output":"said on the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at"}
{"Input":"I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,","Output":"she might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends,"}
{"Input":"they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.","Output":"The house belonged to people in business.  Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied"}
{"Input":"I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,","Output":"and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out,"}
{"Input":"\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think","Output":"Harriet is doing extremely well.  _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_."}

{"Input":"inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey,","Output":"through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express"}
{"Input":"like you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,","Output":"pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife."}
{"Input":"It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses","Output":"there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away."}

{"Input":"Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting","Output":"but to be happy when they got there.  Seven miles were travelled"}
{"Input":"A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving","Output":"pictures in a few words.  Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,"}
{"Input":"before the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch","Output":"the letters when I am here.  It saves trouble, and is a something"}
{"Input":"It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--","Output":"She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction."}

{"Input":"of retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,","Output":"the world was not necessary to _me_.  I could do very well without it."}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,","Output":"&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a"}

{"Input":"when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\"","Output":"\"True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss"}

{"Input":"\"And I have not forgotten,\" said Emma, \"how sure you were that he","Output":"might have come sooner if he would.  You pass it over very handsomely--"}

{"Input":"this summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately","Output":"in love and means to marry her.\""}

{"Input":"my eyes may last me as well.'\"","Output":"All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;"}
{"Input":"I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was","Output":"your doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought"}
{"Input":"connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.","Output":"He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,"}
{"Input":"preferred the society of William Larkins.  No!--she was more and more","Output":"convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise."}
{"Input":"\"Good God!\" cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too!","Output":"Jane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he"}
{"Input":"servants shall go with you to shew you the way.\"","Output":"\"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\""}
{"Input":"Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,","Output":"in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day."}
{"Input":"Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;","Output":"and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,"}
{"Input":"not disturb me.  Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,","Output":"as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.  However,"}
{"Input":"between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural.","Output":"Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each"}
{"Input":"friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley'","Output":"had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;"}
{"Input":"would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;","Output":"and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably"}
{"Input":"complaint alarmed him considerably.\"  And in this style he talked","Output":"on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,"}
{"Input":"such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the","Output":"only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman"}
{"Input":"His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's","Output":"should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,"}
{"Input":"was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near","Output":"as to give Emma time only to say farther,"}
{"Input":"and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_,","Output":"I will break my resolution now.\""}
{"Input":"but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured","Output":"to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.\""}
{"Input":"of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered","Output":"in the perfect happiness of the union."}
{"Input":"\"And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!","Output":"to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,"}
{"Input":"He never can bear to be thanked.  But I thought he would have staid now,","Output":"and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,"}
{"Input":"Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer","Output":"in a manner that appropriated nothing."}
{"Input":"you know.\"","Output":"And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps"}
{"Input":"mean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--","Output":"to suffer her even to think of such a measure!\""}

{"Input":"for you to notice.  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you","Output":"particularly careful as to your associates.  There can be no doubt"}
{"Input":"was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled","Output":"to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but"}
{"Input":"either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.  Command yourself","Output":"enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\""}
{"Input":"with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using","Output":"such words.  Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as"}
{"Input":"Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.","Output":"Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first"}
{"Input":"and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his","Output":"extreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you"}
{"Input":"to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.","Output":"She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness,"}
{"Input":"wanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting","Output":"that she was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is"}

{"Input":"conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only","Output":"a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\""}
{"Input":"will be wanted on Tuesday.  I shall have no fears for you with him.","Output":"We have never been there above once since the new approach was made;"}
{"Input":"\"It is a sort of thing,\" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,","Output":"\"which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to"}
{"Input":"and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to","Output":"Randalls communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove"}
{"Input":"Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,","Output":"so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down"}
{"Input":"and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.","Output":"Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;"}
{"Input":"she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,","Output":"that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful."}
{"Input":"a most distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.--","Output":"Just colour enough for beauty.\""}
{"Input":"certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.","Output":"So Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,"}
{"Input":"I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not","Output":"at all pleased with.  I knew who it came from.  An abominable puppy!--"}
{"Input":"like of your acquaintance with her.\"","Output":"\"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me"}
{"Input":"to refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say","Output":"`No' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into"}
{"Input":"had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield","Output":"in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.  They were alike too,"}
{"Input":"very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,","Output":"or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more"}
{"Input":"They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the","Output":"early was Frank Churchill.  In he walked, the first and the handsomest;"}
{"Input":"and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already","Output":"occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,"}
{"Input":"Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.","Output":"These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick."}
{"Input":"\"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\" said Emma.","Output":"\"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.  I could very"}
{"Input":"\"Yes--a good deal _nearer_.\"","Output":"\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,"}
{"Input":"to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete","Output":"occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,"}
{"Input":"At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,","Output":"evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited"}
{"Input":"Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.","Output":"She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her"}
{"Input":"\"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\"  he soon resumed; and in a tone","Output":"of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was"}
{"Input":"at Highbury!\"","Output":"\"As you do us such ample justice now,\" said Emma, laughing, \"I will"}
{"Input":"He paused.  She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,","Output":"\"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\" said she, in a voice"}
{"Input":"\"Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects","Output":"to her if possible.  It was being very deficient.\""}
{"Input":"Fairfax gave us some very good music.  I do not know a more","Output":"luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained"}
{"Input":"their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary","Output":"virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into"}
{"Input":"and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some","Output":"money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable"}
{"Input":"engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.","Output":"Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,"}
{"Input":"time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.  However, it was","Output":"an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston"}
{"Input":"for any thing in the world.\"","Output":"\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;"}
{"Input":"The smile was returned as Jane answered,","Output":"\"You are very right; it has been thought of.  And I will own"}
{"Input":"at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come","Output":"if any thing was to happen.  But you see, every thing turns out"}
{"Input":"exultation of Mrs. Martin's having \"_two_ parlours, two very good parlours,","Output":"indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room;"}

{"Input":"is detestable in later age.  Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;","Output":"what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?\""}
{"Input":"Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which","Output":"Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and"}
{"Input":"\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,","Output":"with a sigh.  \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\""}

{"Input":"hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,","Output":"to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?\""}
{"Input":"Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,","Output":"indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him."}
{"Input":"he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would","Output":"never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer"}
{"Input":"Half a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got","Output":"back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,"}
{"Input":"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found","Output":"it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--"}
{"Input":"there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without","Output":"a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma's remark was--"}
{"Input":"The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been","Output":"a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's"}
{"Input":"She was not less pleased another day with the manner","Output":"in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture."}
{"Input":"with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--","Output":"The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always"}
{"Input":"whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,","Output":"best in the world."}
{"Input":"I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,","Output":"was not he?  I have an idea he was standing just here.\""}
{"Input":"sent it.\"","Output":"\"I met William Larkins,\" continued Mr. Elton, \"as I got near"}
{"Input":"Emma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word,","Output":"I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,"}
{"Input":"knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"","Output":"\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,"}
{"Input":"\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father.","Output":"\"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,"}
{"Input":"out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak","Output":"with him.  Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk"}
{"Input":"risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.","Output":"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she"}
{"Input":"you either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness.","Output":"If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him"}
{"Input":"as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room","Output":"at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite."}
{"Input":"would have been a stain indeed.","Output":"No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was"}
{"Input":"While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,","Output":"I could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and procure"}
{"Input":"Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in","Output":"interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries"}

{"Input":"Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the","Output":"something which her home required.  Such a friend as Mrs. Weston"}
{"Input":"oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute","Output":"the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she"}
{"Input":"of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,","Output":"of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Elton.  You must grant me that.\"","Output":"\"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.  I Always take the part"}
{"Input":"now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and","Output":"friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;"}
{"Input":"rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were","Output":"a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness"}
{"Input":"a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been","Output":"for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought"}
{"Input":"though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,","Output":"without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away,"}

{"Input":"to you.\"","Output":"Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him"}
{"Input":"and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.","Output":"Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put"}

{"Input":"\"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax","Output":"and her party at Weymouth.\""}
{"Input":"\"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there","Output":"is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook"}
{"Input":"and brought them into the lane again.  \"I do not think it will,\"","Output":"stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,"}
{"Input":"Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little","Output":"did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and"}
{"Input":"I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a","Output":"series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear"}

{"Input":"as there could be any occasion for.  She was quite convinced","Output":"of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love,"}
{"Input":"I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;","Output":"but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak"}
{"Input":"The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly","Output":"ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they"}
{"Input":"had been at Weymouth at the same time.  It was known that they were","Output":"a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma"}
{"Input":"In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale","Output":"are not uncommon.  Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,"}
{"Input":"There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her,","Output":"quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary."}

{"Input":"into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,","Output":"with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--"}
{"Input":"which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,","Output":"had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received"}
{"Input":"As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture","Output":"of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour."}
{"Input":"a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used","Output":"to it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith."}
{"Input":"and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately","Output":"communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed"}
{"Input":"\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,","Output":"is almost enough to make me think so too.  Better be without sense,"}
{"Input":"if we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity","Output":"would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,"}
{"Input":"perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.  Mr. Woodhouse","Output":"taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted."}

{"Input":"every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference","Output":"of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! dear, no, never.\"","Output":"No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,"}
{"Input":"was to us.  And I hope she will be better off in one respect,","Output":"and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long.\""}

{"Input":"It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous","Output":"as herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful"}
{"Input":"there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;","Output":"but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state"}

{"Input":"Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of","Output":"that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,"}

{"Input":"he felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her","Output":"complaint alarmed him considerably.\"  And in this style he talked"}
{"Input":"Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.","Output":"He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,"}
{"Input":"comfortable herself.  The young man's conduct, and his sister's,","Output":"seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them."}

{"Input":"\"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.","Output":"\"Oh! perfectly.  I am always well, you know.  Be sure to give me"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no--none in the least.  I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--","Output":"never looking so well.  Papa is only speaking his own regret.\""}
{"Input":"Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman","Output":"as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must"}

{"Input":"Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.","Output":"He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--"}
{"Input":"I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer","Output":"resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.\""}

{"Input":"away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though","Output":"the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted"}
{"Input":"Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.","Output":"If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper"}

{"Input":"She paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.","Output":"\"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\" she resumed, \"that you should feel"}

{"Input":"it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons'","Output":"understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were"}
{"Input":"and led her up to the top.","Output":"While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,"}

{"Input":"on Isabella's letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain","Output":"of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little"}
{"Input":"He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;","Output":"who could say?  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it."}
{"Input":"Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is","Output":"but one.  Well, I was persuaded there were two.  How very odd!"}
{"Input":"Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed","Output":"to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,"}
{"Input":"\"Had you any idea,\" cried Harriet, \"of his being in love","Output":"with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)"}

{"Input":"rather uneasy.\"","Output":"He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,"}
{"Input":"no music here.  I honour that part of the attention particularly;","Output":"it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.  Nothing hastily"}

{"Input":"papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"","Output":"\"Aye, I wonder which she will.  Poor little dears, how glad they"}
{"Input":"a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.  I am","Output":"a great dreamer.  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--"}

{"Input":"and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,","Output":"or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--"}
{"Input":"She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance","Output":"were unexceptionable."}
{"Input":"Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body","Output":"for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among"}
{"Input":"herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,","Output":"without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first"}

{"Input":"She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not","Output":"a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication"}
{"Input":"Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she","Output":"hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,"}

{"Input":"Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.","Output":"Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew"}
{"Input":"\"No,\" cried Mr. Knightley, \"that need not be the consequence.","Output":"Let them be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure.\""}
{"Input":"Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,","Output":"very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--"}

{"Input":"It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character","Output":"which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,"}

{"Input":"Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations.","Output":"It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are"}
{"Input":"and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.","Output":"When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked"}
{"Input":"\"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\" cried Mr. Knightley.--\"Robert","Output":"Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend"}
{"Input":"an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,","Output":"and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving"}

{"Input":"in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could","Output":"say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest."}
{"Input":"The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,","Output":"was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look."}
{"Input":"all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.","Output":"He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such"}
{"Input":"Is she really not ill?\"","Output":"\"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it"}
{"Input":"\"_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much","Output":"in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue,"}

{"Input":"that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,","Output":"when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be"}
{"Input":"acquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated","Output":"to him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--"}
{"Input":"but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very","Output":"same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove."}
{"Input":"extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.","Output":"Half a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got"}
{"Input":"absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect","Output":"liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:"}

{"Input":"of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows","Output":"of a circumstance which highly entertained her:  but his gaiety did"}
{"Input":"but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst","Output":"the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense,"}
{"Input":"It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister","Output":"was _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence"}
{"Input":"only it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you direct","Output":"in this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever"}
{"Input":"brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,","Output":"and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded"}
{"Input":"was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request","Output":"to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--"}
{"Input":"which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,","Output":"the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,"}
{"Input":"It may be possible to do without dancing entirely.  Instances have","Output":"been known of young people passing many, many months successively,"}
{"Input":"\"It is odd though,\" observed his father, \"that you should have had such","Output":"a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you"}
{"Input":"but I cannot stay to hear it.\"","Output":"\"Oh!  Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--"}
{"Input":"\"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject","Output":"talked of.\""}
{"Input":"when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very","Output":"bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in"}

{"Input":"and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work","Output":"for them.  Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea"}
{"Input":"Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully","Output":"was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing."}
{"Input":"of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for","Output":"his subsequent consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet,"}
{"Input":"from his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.","Output":"He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such"}
{"Input":"It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton","Output":"was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston"}
{"Input":"of that?--Very true.  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--","Output":"`You must go,' said she.  `You and I must part.  You will have no"}
{"Input":"I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.","Output":"How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any"}
{"Input":"what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution","Output":"he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would"}
{"Input":"As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much","Output":"safer character,) she was truly welcome.  Her approbation, at once"}
{"Input":"and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--","Output":"oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute"}
{"Input":"\"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--","Output":"or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements"}

{"Input":"The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,","Output":"my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to."}
{"Input":"in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so","Output":"anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he"}

{"Input":"\"Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.","Output":"Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how"}
{"Input":"frightful news.  The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies.","Output":"Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,"}
{"Input":"twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.","Output":"The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly"}
{"Input":"but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better","Output":"be soon.  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder"}

{"Input":"but value.\"","Output":"\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,"}
{"Input":"just the happy medium.  When you have been here a little longer,","Output":"Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard"}
{"Input":"Ten couple may stand here very well.\"","Output":"Emma demurred.  \"It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could"}
{"Input":"He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \"the pianoforte!","Output":"Ah!  That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young"}
{"Input":"of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept","Output":"another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she"}
{"Input":"was which they were so anxious for.","Output":"\"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston's parting question."}
{"Input":"nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse","Output":"lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not"}
{"Input":"I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.","Output":"A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.\""}
{"Input":"as must prevent any second application.  She must abide by the evil","Output":"of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,"}

{"Input":"was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,","Output":"the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first"}
{"Input":"She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she","Output":"was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as"}

{"Input":"and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject","Output":"of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall"}
{"Input":"Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it","Output":"unsaid the next moment.\""}
{"Input":"I remember, he came to me quite in despair.\"","Output":"She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly"}
{"Input":"father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,","Output":"that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very"}
{"Input":"very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy","Output":"spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty"}
{"Input":"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,","Output":"without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering"}
{"Input":"very little of the matter.  He understood what would be welcome;","Output":"he could be sure of little else.  \"His father's marriage,\" he said,"}
{"Input":"And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--","Output":"so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then"}
{"Input":"her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation","Output":"that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\""}
{"Input":"Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate","Output":"in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero"}
{"Input":"And she, \"Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,","Output":"but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\""}
{"Input":"regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes","Output":"fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father."}
{"Input":"arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.","Output":"The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it"}
{"Input":"her opinion, with a \"Well, well,\" and was at last forced to add,","Output":"\"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?\""}
{"Input":"of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give","Output":"up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the"}
{"Input":"\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away,","Output":"it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will"}
{"Input":"and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.","Output":"Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,"}
{"Input":"her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.","Output":"It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it"}
{"Input":"a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.","Output":"This is precisely what I wanted.  Well, pretty good news, is not it?"}
{"Input":"said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma","Output":"immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend"}
{"Input":"of Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,","Output":"and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,"}
{"Input":"my conscience.  And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would","Output":"be much disturbed by Miss Bates.  Little things do not irritate him."}
{"Input":"and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared","Output":"her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must"}
{"Input":"not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told","Output":"her he loved her.\""}
{"Input":"one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,","Output":"we need not talk much on the subject.\""}
{"Input":"she found.  \"He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he","Output":"was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\"--She thought"}
{"Input":"of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,","Output":"had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.  They were"}
{"Input":"but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention","Output":"from them.  And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,"}
{"Input":"\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always","Output":"a sickly season.  Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be."}
{"Input":"but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you","Output":"different creatures; you do not look like the same.  Now I cannot say,"}
{"Input":"\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you","Output":"in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I"}
{"Input":"the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was","Output":"called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert"}
{"Input":"and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect","Output":"to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's"}
{"Input":"And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment","Output":"repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it."}
{"Input":"said I--well, and just then came the note.  A Miss Hawkins--","Output":"that's all I know.  A Miss Hawkins of Bath.  But, Mr. Knightley,"}
{"Input":"as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish","Output":"my eyes may last me as well.'\""}
{"Input":"It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he","Output":"might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley"}
{"Input":"\"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she","Output":"is destined to be?\""}
{"Input":"circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I","Output":"am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid."}
{"Input":"better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,","Output":"and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for"}
{"Input":"\"that one of the great recommendations of this change would","Output":"be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--"}
{"Input":"\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get","Output":"near every body, and say every thing.  My dear Emma, I am longing"}
{"Input":"to be guided by any one she looked up to.  Her early attachment","Output":"to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,"}
{"Input":"and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report","Output":"his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own."}
{"Input":"it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.","Output":"I think your manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend,"}
{"Input":"and constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends;","Output":"they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning."}
{"Input":"I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.  I have","Output":"engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me.  She has been so kind as"}
{"Input":"communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner","Output":"in which they had been received."}

{"Input":"shall go home.  But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear","Output":"the instrument.\""}
{"Input":"verses and charades like this.\"","Output":"Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's prose."}
{"Input":"little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to","Output":"bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms"}
{"Input":"the truth.  Harriet had no penetration.  She had been satisfied","Output":"to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;"}
{"Input":"Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.","Output":"He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion"}
{"Input":"of the song, and every thing usual followed.  He was accused","Output":"of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;"}
{"Input":"Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.","Output":"It can be round in five minutes.\""}
{"Input":"he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?  But Harriet rejected","Output":"the suspicion with spirit."}
{"Input":"retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.","Output":"She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out."}
{"Input":"but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--","Output":"She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,"}
{"Input":"and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful","Output":"consideration.  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,"}
{"Input":"the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,","Output":"she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the"}
{"Input":"\"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked","Output":"forward to the summer in general.\""}
{"Input":"Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.","Output":"The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's"}
{"Input":"between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,","Output":"there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:"}
{"Input":"I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could","Output":"not have imagined it.  It is so much beyond any thing I deserve."}
{"Input":"to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.  Two or three more","Output":"of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to"}
{"Input":"wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience","Output":"with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;","Output":"and amused to think how little information I obtained.\""}
{"Input":"think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,","Output":"which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself."}
{"Input":"she heard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\"","Output":"repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables"}
{"Input":"that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,","Output":"she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word"}
{"Input":"\"You are going in, I suppose?\" said he.","Output":"\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner"}
{"Input":"we do want a larger council.  Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates","Output":"to join us?\""}
{"Input":"The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly","Output":"be lessened by his marriage.  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--"}
{"Input":"on which the superior families would visit them.  This lesson,","Output":"she very much feared, they would receive only from herself;"}
{"Input":"At first it was downright dulness to Emma.  She had never seen Frank","Output":"Churchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--"}
{"Input":"of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.  Mr. Weston was","Output":"chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;"}
{"Input":"to know beforehand _when_ it will be.\"","Output":"Emma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied,"}
{"Input":"Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every","Output":"proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the"}
{"Input":"She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect","Output":"confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty."}
{"Input":"and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.","Output":"Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,"}
{"Input":"Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.","Output":"\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get"}
{"Input":"It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.","Output":"I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets"}
{"Input":"what is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your","Output":"sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\""}
{"Input":"was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail","Output":"so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have"}
{"Input":"which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior","Output":"to our own.\""}
{"Input":"And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look","Output":"at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,"}
{"Input":"evil than good from them.  Emma listened with the warmest concern;","Output":"grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover"}
{"Input":"appearances of the next few days.","Output":"The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after"}
{"Input":"She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place","Output":"in her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse","Output":"opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.  It made him so"}
{"Input":"as in situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.","Output":"What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,"}
{"Input":"and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart","Output":"and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him"}
{"Input":"she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,","Output":"Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.\""}

{"Input":"find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done","Output":"her more good than any thing else in the world could do."}
{"Input":"Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,","Output":"entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again."}
{"Input":"It was a right thing to do.  I went in for three minutes, and was","Output":"detained by Miss Bates's being absent.  She was out; and I felt it"}
{"Input":"but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,","Output":"without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in"}
{"Input":"and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.","Output":"At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,"}

{"Input":"provoking indifference about it.  Either because he did not","Output":"dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his"}

{"Input":"and obliging.  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring","Output":"her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,"}

{"Input":"I thought it very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea","Output":"you know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\""}
{"Input":"and pretension, now spread over his air.  She was, in fact,","Output":"beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing"}

{"Input":"\"I do not believe any such thing,\" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded","Output":"that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;"}

{"Input":"they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;","Output":"and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it"}

{"Input":"\"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.","Output":"I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\""}
{"Input":"She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor","Output":"Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard"}
{"Input":"could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely","Output":"are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is"}
{"Input":"\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again.","Output":"\"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would"}
{"Input":"but it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?\"","Output":"\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what"}
{"Input":"having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,","Output":"was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,"}

{"Input":"He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,","Output":"about Jane's age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits"}
{"Input":"more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\"","Output":"\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree"}
{"Input":"or she could not have been so misled.","Output":"The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--"}
{"Input":"This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;","Output":"but it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay when"}
{"Input":"tell you what they are.\"","Output":"\"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability."}
{"Input":"whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,","Output":"with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment"}

{"Input":"she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged","Output":"to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it"}
{"Input":"could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised","Output":"over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in"}
{"Input":"warm-hearted woman.  I like them all.\"","Output":"\"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she"}
{"Input":"the whole.\"","Output":"\"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,"}
{"Input":"used sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost","Output":"to a fault, bore with them much better.\""}
{"Input":"returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,","Output":"should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance."}
{"Input":"and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  Mr. Perry","Output":"could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must"}
{"Input":"persuading her not to accept young Martin.  There I was quite right.","Output":"That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left"}
{"Input":"there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in","Output":"her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--"}
{"Input":"way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed","Output":"to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into","Output":"my feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious"}
{"Input":"\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how","Output":"great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\""}
{"Input":"preserve her.  It was his duty.","Output":"\"Pray, Emma,\" said he, \"may I ask in what lay the great amusement,"}
{"Input":"of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was","Output":"tolerably convincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able"}
{"Input":"twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"","Output":"\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again."}
{"Input":"strange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,","Output":"that _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity"}
{"Input":"but Jane is taking them in.\"","Output":"\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were"}
{"Input":"as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing","Output":"Harriet's confidence.  To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote"}
{"Input":"possible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude","Output":"of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give"}
{"Input":"so did their satisfaction in each other.  As a walking companion,","Output":"Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her."}
{"Input":"and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle","Output":"that it wants.  And now, let me talk to you of something else."}
{"Input":"ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,","Output":"and driving very steady."}
{"Input":"and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they","Output":"could be disposed of."}
{"Input":"\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--","Output":"much worse than the other.  A room at an inn was always damp"}
{"Input":"She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation","Output":"but the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--"}
{"Input":"\"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\"","Output":"It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that"}
{"Input":"for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more","Output":"heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.\""}
{"Input":"Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could","Output":"be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,"}
{"Input":"seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,","Output":"which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,"}
{"Input":"And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,","Output":"we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her."}
{"Input":"continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,","Output":"concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy"}
{"Input":"The carriage came:  and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on","Output":"such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley"}
{"Input":"degree of publicity.","Output":"\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she."}
{"Input":"Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's","Output":"state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being"}
{"Input":"Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\"","Output":"She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she"}
{"Input":"and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host","Output":"of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do"}
{"Input":"that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.\"","Output":"Emma laughed and disclaimed.  He continued,"}
{"Input":"to dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not told me","Output":"that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been"}
{"Input":"every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply","Output":"growing older should make me indifferent about letters.\""}
{"Input":"\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.  We shall not be many,","Output":"you know.\""}
{"Input":"obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to","Output":"put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort."}
{"Input":"\"You did behave very shamefully.  You never wrote a truer line.\"","Output":"And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis"}
{"Input":"the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,","Output":"was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort"}
{"Input":"quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate","Output":"creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,"}
{"Input":"She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.","Output":"It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John"}
{"Input":"at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they","Output":"might decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many"}
{"Input":"She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it","Output":"was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,"}
{"Input":"your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,","Output":"we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!  Mr. Weston,"}
{"Input":"\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never","Output":"occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\""}
{"Input":"for Enscombe without delay.","Output":"The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note"}
{"Input":"a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends","Output":"who included me in it.\""}
{"Input":"Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word","Output":"to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?  But I want"}
{"Input":"from time to time.","Output":"The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;"}
{"Input":"as a great treat.\"","Output":"\"My dearest Harriet!\" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,"}
{"Input":"others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress","Output":"and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained."}
{"Input":"all the way through.  But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"","Output":"\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.  We copied it"}
{"Input":"never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could","Output":"summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,"}
{"Input":"and was now forming all her views of happiness.","Output":"Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:"}
{"Input":"it would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,","Output":"they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--"}
{"Input":"His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,","Output":"their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.  Such a companion"}
{"Input":"Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she","Output":"had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually"}
{"Input":"circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I","Output":"can at all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--"}
{"Input":"It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from","Output":"the stairs.\""}
{"Input":"and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have","Output":"his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks"}
{"Input":"the sort of thing that so few men would think of.  And, in short,","Output":"from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think"}
{"Input":"Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;","Output":"she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in"}
{"Input":"my heart.  This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride","Output":"in creating.  This is a connexion which offers nothing but good."}
{"Input":"\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought","Output":"so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's"}
{"Input":"\"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--","Output":"he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he"}
{"Input":"plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.","Output":"They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the"}

{"Input":"I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first,","Output":"before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there"}
{"Input":"before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.","Output":"My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.\""}

{"Input":"replied Emma, smiling; \"but you do not mean to deny that there","Output":"was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason"}
{"Input":"was then their own portion.  He had left them completely frightened;","Output":"and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,"}
{"Input":"Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him","Output":"if he had paid it."}
{"Input":"I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for","Output":"the world!  He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from"}
{"Input":"Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was","Output":"understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion."}
{"Input":"him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of","Output":"finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--"}

{"Input":"the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,","Output":"and fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace"}
{"Input":"\"I cannot think there is any danger of it,\" was Emma's calm answer--","Output":"\"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation"}
{"Input":"It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a","Output":"similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with"}
{"Input":"(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must","Output":"be a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should."}
{"Input":"\"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--","Output":"and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  Well,"}
{"Input":"\"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\"","Output":"\"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\""}
{"Input":"had supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not","Output":"have believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,"}

{"Input":"in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,","Output":"\"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,"}
{"Input":"to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort","Output":"of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led"}
{"Input":"Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,","Output":"Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect"}
{"Input":"\"By all means.  We shall be most happy to consider you as one","Output":"of the party.\""}
{"Input":"she is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,","Output":"or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities"}
{"Input":"the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.","Output":"His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,"}
{"Input":"\"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,","Output":"who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,"}
{"Input":"poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung","Output":"about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that"}
{"Input":"He seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!' said he,","Output":"`I can fasten the rivet.  I like a job of that sort excessively.'"}
{"Input":"Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own","Output":"behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of"}
{"Input":"if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,","Output":"the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;"}
{"Input":"Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:","Output":"but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,"}
{"Input":"Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.","Output":"Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing"}

{"Input":"Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward!  Had she left her where","Output":"she ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,"}
{"Input":"She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;","Output":"and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now"}

{"Input":"attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,","Output":"and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect."}
{"Input":"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude","Output":"to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her"}
{"Input":"and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition","Output":"and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular"}
{"Input":"shake of the hand.","Output":"Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,"}
{"Input":"It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.  A pleasant","Output":"\"thank you\" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,"}

{"Input":"What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,","Output":"to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural"}
{"Input":"One would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!--","Output":"Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be"}

{"Input":"real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.","Output":"\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley,"}

{"Input":"\"We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have;","Output":"not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;"}
{"Input":"just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have","Output":"a very good effect.  The Churchills might not have a word to say"}
{"Input":"or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her","Output":"to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking"}
{"Input":"\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware","Output":"of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry"}

{"Input":"but all in vain.  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;","Output":"Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out"}
{"Input":"But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely","Output":"worn out.  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,"}

{"Input":"Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;","Output":"but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her."}
{"Input":"indispensable to wish him a good night.  The compliment was just returned,","Output":"coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,"}

{"Input":"Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.","Output":"It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining"}

{"Input":"superior duty.","Output":"In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,"}
{"Input":"\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner","Output":"in which he still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn."}
{"Input":"and take care of yourself to-night.\"","Output":"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;"}
{"Input":"and Emma.  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had","Output":"been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than"}
{"Input":"she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.","Output":"\"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\"--"}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry","Output":"or John.  Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,"}
{"Input":"the proper invitation.","Output":"She hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it"}
{"Input":"she voluntarily said;--","Output":"\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball."}
{"Input":"of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"","Output":"\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--"}
{"Input":"The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,","Output":"whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,"}
{"Input":"They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well, my dear,\"","Output":"said he, as they entered the room--\"I have brought her, and now"}
{"Input":"Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing","Output":"more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,"}
{"Input":"till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long","Output":"looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects"}
{"Input":"and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?","Output":"It was folly to be disturbed by it.  Of course, he must be sorry"}
{"Input":"He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,","Output":"she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.  It seemed as if"}
{"Input":"and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.  I shall","Output":"never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day"}
{"Input":"but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.  She is poor;","Output":"she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live"}
{"Input":"would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton's","Output":"invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.\""}
{"Input":"But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted","Output":"his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;"}
{"Input":"take place!\"","Output":"\"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and"}

{"Input":"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be","Output":"supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she"}
{"Input":"looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it","Output":"suited her to give.  And this belief produced another dread."}
{"Input":"of her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--","Output":"You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)"}
{"Input":"very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--","Output":"yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--"}
{"Input":"confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!","Output":"I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it."}
{"Input":"last night.\"","Output":"\"Do come with me,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if it be not very disagreeable"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested","Output":"by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her"}
{"Input":"\"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied","Output":"by the idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder"}
{"Input":"\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,","Output":"to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)"}

{"Input":"It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--","Output":"and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared","Output":"to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young","Output":"man so much in want of a change.  You will stay, and go with us?\""}
{"Input":"\"`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,","Output":"from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal."}
{"Input":"and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.","Output":"At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,"}
{"Input":"but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's","Output":"name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,"}
{"Input":"and long, very long, did they occupy her.","Output":"CHAPTER XV"}
{"Input":"but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence","Output":"of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley"}
{"Input":"never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer","Output":"a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she"}
{"Input":"gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner,","Output":"with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill"}
{"Input":"I am sure.\"","Output":"Harriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round"}
{"Input":"and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,","Output":"and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect"}
{"Input":"while we were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"","Output":"\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware"}
{"Input":"one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor","Output":"if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself"}
{"Input":"addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being","Output":"highly interesting to every body in the room.  He gave her a letter,"}
{"Input":"that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been","Output":"long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;","Output":"and she came in his way.\""}
{"Input":"and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the","Output":"impropriety of his conduct.\""}
{"Input":"and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,","Output":"to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,"}
{"Input":"and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.","Output":"She was your governess, I think?\""}
{"Input":"\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.","Output":"Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still"}
{"Input":"enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her","Output":"the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique"}
{"Input":"but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive","Output":"against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,","Output":"except that you were too late for the best strawberries."}
{"Input":"and are by no means implicitly guided by others.  I give you notice","Output":"that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer.\""}
{"Input":"that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts","Output":"of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,"}
{"Input":"and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor","Output":"failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do"}
{"Input":"I shall not discuss it here.  For my temptation to _think_ it a right,","Output":"I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,"}
{"Input":"She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn","Output":"from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed"}
{"Input":"They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it","Output":"was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,"}
{"Input":"she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could","Output":"yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him"}
{"Input":"she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late","Output":"disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him"}
{"Input":"Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,","Output":"and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two"}
{"Input":"Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that","Output":"was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home"}
{"Input":"a minister of state.  I managed it extremely well.\"","Output":"Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every"}

{"Input":"old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this","Output":"to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he"}

{"Input":"She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction","Output":"which silenced, Mr. Knightley.  She was in gay spirits, and would"}
{"Input":"as I knew had been given her in the morning.\"","Output":"Emma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part"}
{"Input":"\"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she","Output":"probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding"}

{"Input":"\"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.","Output":"Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--"}

{"Input":"This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.","Output":"This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,"}

{"Input":"you know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay","Output":"a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon"}
{"Input":"the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.","Output":"Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting."}
{"Input":"Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her","Output":"superior duty."}
{"Input":"Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had","Output":"gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,"}
{"Input":"He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,","Output":"and her tongue motionless.  They were combined only of anger"}
{"Input":"      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;","Output":"    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,"}
{"Input":"all her prophecies for the last six weeks.","Output":"The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight"}
{"Input":"as possible.\"","Output":"\"Not quite,\" returned Emma, with forced calmness, \"for all that"}
{"Input":"Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one","Output":"important service which his better sense would have rendered her,"}
{"Input":"His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them","Output":"with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not"}
{"Input":"Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just","Output":"at this time was the very thing to be desired.  She admired"}
{"Input":"Have not I some right to complain?  I am sure of your kind support","Output":"and aid.\""}
{"Input":"\"Aye, I wonder which she will.  Poor little dears, how glad they","Output":"will be to come.  They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\""}
{"Input":"at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her","Output":"first remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\""}
{"Input":"\"Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,","Output":"and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John"}
{"Input":"A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead","Output":"the way to a return of old feelings.  The touch seemed immediate."}
{"Input":"that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her","Output":"father's footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was"}

{"Input":"He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.  I do not","Output":"know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either"}
{"Input":"in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair","Output":"to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,"}
{"Input":"with compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified.","Output":"She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event"}
{"Input":"was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,","Output":"but not less to the purpose.  To know that _she_ thought his coming"}
{"Input":"and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.","Output":"\"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office"}
{"Input":"and he will be with us within a fortnight.\"","Output":"Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented"}
{"Input":"where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--","Output":"not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.\""}
{"Input":"own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men","Output":"who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,"}
{"Input":"a very ill-judged measure.\"","Output":"Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he"}
{"Input":"\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.","Output":"\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella"}
{"Input":"\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn:  \"never, I assure you.","Output":"_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort"}
{"Input":"were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to","Output":"the pleasantness of her neighbour.  The first remote sound to which"}
{"Input":"Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference","Output":"to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind."}
{"Input":"Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he","Output":"says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\""}
{"Input":"and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.","Output":"To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the"}

{"Input":"He did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked","Output":"towards Randalls most days.  He has not been able to get the"}
{"Input":"and his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case:","Output":"and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,"}
{"Input":"\"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made","Output":"a great difference in your way of life.\""}
{"Input":"and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, \"These are my","Output":"own concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being"}
{"Input":"look sorrowful, and have done.","Output":"\"Perhaps it is as well,\" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma"}
{"Input":"though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly","Output":"tell you what they are.\""}
{"Input":"like to have him always on the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true.","Output":"Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see"}
{"Input":"of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--","Output":"and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this"}
{"Input":"But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.","Output":"It would be such a delight to have her picture!\""}
{"Input":"Woodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare","Output":"herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,"}
{"Input":"You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour","Output":"to read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself.\""}
{"Input":"one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible","Output":"thing in preference to a division of the party."}
{"Input":"his eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,","Output":"it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,"}
{"Input":"how it might all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there","Output":"was smoothness outwardly.  But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from"}
{"Input":"and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would","Output":"be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even"}

{"Input":"shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said","Output":"nothing about it to any body.  It would only be giving trouble"}

{"Input":"should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.  He cannot","Output":"want money--he cannot want leisure.  We know, on the contrary,"}
{"Input":"was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from","Output":"Mr. Knightley would soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation,"}
{"Input":"but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of","Output":"drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--"}
{"Input":"you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,","Output":"and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated"}
{"Input":"with _very_ great pleasure.\"","Output":"It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have"}
{"Input":"a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view","Output":"which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly"}

{"Input":"surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.  But Jane,","Output":"it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said"}
{"Input":"so cold, so cautious!  There was no getting at her real opinion.","Output":"Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined"}
{"Input":"_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear","Output":"of retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,"}
{"Input":"said Jane.  \"I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will","Output":"want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself."}

{"Input":"This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--","Output":"the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became."}
{"Input":"Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;","Output":"however, she called me back presently, and let me look too,"}
{"Input":"Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.","Output":"Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,"}
{"Input":"about Jane's age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits","Output":"and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.  Where I have a regard,","Output":"I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed"}
{"Input":"have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax","Output":"could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer."}
{"Input":"be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.","Output":"At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel."}
{"Input":"and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did","Output":"not come.  Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would"}

{"Input":"\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"","Output":"\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess"}
{"Input":"\"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,","Output":"talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,"}

{"Input":"she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on","Output":"their way at a quick pace for Randalls."}
{"Input":"so very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\"","Output":"\"Mrs. Weston's manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good."}

{"Input":"before him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my","Output":"utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)"}

{"Input":"You must promise me not to sit up.\"","Output":"He did, on the condition of some promises on her side:  such as that,"}
{"Input":"\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he","Output":"received it."}
{"Input":"with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of","Output":"continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,"}
{"Input":"she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.","Output":"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many"}
{"Input":"but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not","Output":"deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly."}
{"Input":"habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon","Output":"afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness"}
{"Input":"was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,","Output":"it would not have struck her.  As a sort of touchstone, however,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! that's all.  I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--","Output":"except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,"}
{"Input":"There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every","Output":"thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--"}
{"Input":"with any necessity, or even any power of speech.","Output":"CHAPTER IV"}
{"Input":"\"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very","Output":"agreeable young lady.  She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama"}
{"Input":"in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.","Output":"Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston."}
{"Input":"excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize","Output":"every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was"}
{"Input":"being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration","Output":"made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible."}
{"Input":"make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of","Output":"nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,"}
{"Input":"His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,","Output":"did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;"}

{"Input":"I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.","Output":"How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I"}
{"Input":"in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak","Output":"and when to hold my tongue.  Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill."}
{"Input":"except that you were too late for the best strawberries.","Output":"I was a kinder friend than you deserved.  But you were humble."}
{"Input":"alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,","Output":"which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was"}
{"Input":"\"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.","Output":"\"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage"}

{"Input":"were in favour of a pleasant party.  Mr. Weston directed the whole,","Output":"officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every"}
{"Input":"an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston","Output":"a great deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth,"}
{"Input":"and quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,","Output":"which made the information she received more valuable."}
{"Input":"two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;","Output":"and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,"}
{"Input":"better neighbour.  You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.","Output":"My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,"}
{"Input":"of pitiful resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had","Output":"talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,"}
{"Input":"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her","Output":"fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known."}
{"Input":"there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my","Output":"children in:  but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks"}
{"Input":"\"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"","Output":"\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\""}
{"Input":"dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston","Output":"was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall","Output":"have been let off easily.\""}

{"Input":"to disappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that","Output":"superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--"}
{"Input":"who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.","Output":"It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses"}
{"Input":"sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was","Output":"close to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange"}
{"Input":"my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,","Output":"in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my"}
{"Input":"with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none","Output":"of them know of the engagement?\""}
{"Input":"but she abstained.  She was quite determined not to utter a word","Output":"that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed"}
{"Input":"Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves","Output":"with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be"}
{"Input":"and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression","Output":"towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins."}
{"Input":"If it was not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid","Output":"we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly."}
{"Input":"and Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma grew sick at the sound.","Output":"She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;"}
{"Input":"luxurious, and selfish too.  If Frank Churchill had wanted to see","Output":"his father, he would have contrived it between September and January."}
{"Input":"people get together--and they always do.  Now, here will be Mr. Elton","Output":"and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;"}
{"Input":"of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,","Output":"which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated"}
{"Input":"During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just","Output":"enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her"}
{"Input":"that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,","Output":"he would have been accepted after all."}
{"Input":"if it were to end in his being so at last.  Do not beat me.\"","Output":"CHAPTER XVI"}
{"Input":"there is to question.  If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?\"","Output":"\"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\""}
{"Input":"of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and","Output":"grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts"}
{"Input":"by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage","Output":"ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,"}
{"Input":"afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses","Output":"in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?\""}
{"Input":"for his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen","Output":"or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;"}
{"Input":"Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words","Output":"of eager exclamation.  Emma continued,"}
{"Input":"all the rest of her life.  Her second duty now, inferior only to her","Output":"father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour"}
{"Input":"She regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been","Output":"forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard"}

{"Input":"many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,","Output":"a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,"}
{"Input":"would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,","Output":"is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It"}
{"Input":"of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,","Output":"now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate."}
{"Input":"between them.","Output":"Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind"}
{"Input":"is over.\"","Output":"\"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\""}
{"Input":"and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is","Output":"an excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation"}
{"Input":"to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,","Output":"or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;"}
{"Input":"she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.","Output":"He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence."}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew","Output":"Mr. Elton looked up to him."}
{"Input":"In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.  Her father","Output":"never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground"}
{"Input":"She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt","Output":"on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory,"}
{"Input":"health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to","Output":"listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter"}

{"Input":"A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,","Output":"excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet"}
{"Input":"Do not distress her.\"","Output":"He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little"}
{"Input":"\"How sorry I am!  But colds were never so prevalent as they have been","Output":"this autumn.  Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them"}
{"Input":"communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed","Output":"into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most"}
{"Input":"he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.","Output":"What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,"}
{"Input":"for tears were in her eyes perpetually.  One cannot wonder,","Output":"one cannot wonder.  It is a great change; and though she is"}
{"Input":"I should have made some discoveries.\"","Output":"\"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,"}
{"Input":"thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,","Output":"was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,"}
{"Input":"which already engaged her mind.  The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's","Output":"importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was"}
{"Input":"\"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\"","Output":"\"No, no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don't ask me.  I promised my wife"}
{"Input":"on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend","Output":"to his.\""}
{"Input":"a disposition more truly amiable.\"","Output":"\"I have no doubt of it.\" And it was spoken with a sort"}
{"Input":"The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter","Output":"feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side,"}
{"Input":"important service which his better sense would have rendered her,","Output":"to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all"}
{"Input":"Fairfax is.\"","Output":"And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he"}
{"Input":"me comfortable again.\"","Output":"Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in"}
{"Input":"pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.","Output":"In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her."}
{"Input":"a day beyond his fortnight.  But this was not judged feasible.","Output":"The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly"}
{"Input":"Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only","Output":"of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing"}
{"Input":"\"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she,","Output":"\"but for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let"}
{"Input":"of the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.","Output":"\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination"}
{"Input":"But it was so, I suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I","Output":"was staying with them the other day.  I believe I did not play"}
{"Input":"The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;","Output":"and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission"}
{"Input":"and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,","Output":"that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting."}
{"Input":"in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;","Output":"she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration"}
{"Input":"and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.","Output":"It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked"}

{"Input":"would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.","Output":"It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with"}
{"Input":"The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.","Output":"Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about."}
{"Input":"did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend","Output":"the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she"}
{"Input":"the sister and the aunt.","Output":"This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--"}
{"Input":"Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;","Output":"he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,"}
{"Input":"perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.","Output":"You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what"}
{"Input":"Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do","Output":"just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have"}
{"Input":"There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.","Output":"\"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\""}
{"Input":"`No' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into","Output":"with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty"}
{"Input":"\"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--","Output":"had _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\""}

{"Input":"my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.","Output":"You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--"}
{"Input":"\"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill.","Output":"But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?"}
{"Input":"to his.\"","Output":"\"I rather doubt that.  You are very fond of bending little minds;"}
{"Input":"and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously","Output":"pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined."}
{"Input":"infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such","Output":"a woman as Mrs. Elton.  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\""}
{"Input":"relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her","Output":"own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,"}
{"Input":"\"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the","Output":"clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you","Output":"would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying","Output":"not to smile.\""}
{"Input":"\"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters","Output":"of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?\""}

{"Input":"which both might not have heard.\"","Output":"\"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,"}
{"Input":"their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out","Output":"of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas."}
{"Input":"I did.  Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me","Output":"of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all"}
{"Input":"sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;","Output":"and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined."}

{"Input":"\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage","Output":"more useful on such occasions.  It is not that I am without the wish;"}
{"Input":"So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced","Output":"her that every thing need not be put off.  Why should not they"}

{"Input":"Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still","Output":"afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us."}
{"Input":"nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no","Output":"right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no"}
{"Input":"No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his","Output":"own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--"}

{"Input":"that we are expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning,","Output":"and he will be with us within a fortnight.\""}
{"Input":"in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;","Output":"for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more"}
{"Input":"had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits","Output":"were quite overcome.  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:"}
{"Input":"\"We were too magnificent,\" said he.  \"We allowed unnecessary room.","Output":"Ten couple may stand here very well.\""}
{"Input":"Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe","Output":"the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,"}
{"Input":"For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as","Output":"I am.\""}

{"Input":"from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged","Output":"that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond"}
{"Input":"young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am","Output":"rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her."}
{"Input":"Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,","Output":"by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears,"}
{"Input":"to air.\"","Output":"\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.  You make the best of it--"}
{"Input":"and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable","Output":"suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had"}

{"Input":"Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined","Output":"in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she"}
{"Input":"reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.","Output":"She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character,"}
{"Input":"with us at least.  Three months, she says so, positively, as I","Output":"am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.  The case is,"}
{"Input":"about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that","Output":"he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages"}

{"Input":"The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note","Output":"from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,"}
{"Input":"with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit","Output":"that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;"}
{"Input":"can have nothing to do.  A degree or two lower, and a creditable","Output":"appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their"}

{"Input":"whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,","Output":"and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained"}
{"Input":"no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.  Without knowing","Output":"when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,"}
{"Input":"she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.","Output":"She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--"}
{"Input":"must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates","Output":"of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance"}
{"Input":"and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,","Output":"and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,"}
{"Input":"living together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple","Output":"Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end"}
{"Input":"And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.  It seemed","Output":"at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied."}
{"Input":"very evident.  He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,","Output":"that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,"}
{"Input":"and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering","Output":"with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished"}
{"Input":"\"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me.","Output":"I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.  Leave shame to her."}
{"Input":"\"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.","Output":"    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."}
{"Input":"for ever.  Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred","Output":"to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--"}
{"Input":"to lace up her boot, without _recollecting_.  A thousand vexatious","Output":"thoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;"}

{"Input":"How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!  How could","Output":"she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!"}

{"Input":"Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,","Output":"but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow."}
{"Input":"The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.","Output":"The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort"}
{"Input":"and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of","Output":"Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right"}

{"Input":"and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that","Output":"she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous"}
{"Input":"in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,","Output":"and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could"}

{"Input":"flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending","Output":"they were never to have a disengaged day."}
{"Input":"such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed","Output":"every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had"}
{"Input":"indeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,\"","Output":"with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider"}
{"Input":"disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,","Output":"and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance."}
{"Input":"The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined","Output":"cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his"}

{"Input":"and I do not think you ever will.  Isabella cannot bear to stay","Output":"behind her husband.\""}
{"Input":"she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live","Output":"to old age, must probably sink more.  Her situation should secure"}
{"Input":"\"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,","Output":"and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\""}
{"Input":"\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,","Output":"and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--"}
{"Input":"though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering","Output":"under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made"}
{"Input":"Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.","Output":"And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning"}

{"Input":"beyond the first eight lines.\"","Output":"Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say."}
{"Input":"afterwards to herself.  \"There is nothing to be compared to it.","Output":"Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,"}
{"Input":"for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared","Output":"for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be"}
{"Input":"A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste","Output":"is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely"}
{"Input":"made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.","Output":"In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale"}
{"Input":"My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt","Output":"of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,"}
{"Input":"and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of","Output":"the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--"}
{"Input":"must be very tiresome.  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,","Output":"before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.\""}
{"Input":"no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;","Output":"and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!"}
{"Input":"thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love","Output":"with another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections","Output":"as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,","Output":"you know.  Surry is the garden of England.\""}
{"Input":"of the fine glow of health.  Where features were indifferent,","Output":"a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,"}
{"Input":"In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared","Output":"at first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,"}
{"Input":"\"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.  Miss Fairfax knows it","Output":"is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first."}
{"Input":"who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,","Output":"was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma."}
{"Input":"as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,","Output":"for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--"}
{"Input":"I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.  I am","Output":"quite enough in love.  I should be sorry to be more.\""}
{"Input":"\"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr. Weston's","Output":"quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting."}
{"Input":"\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"","Output":"\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it"}
{"Input":"\"I am afraid Jane is not very well,\" said she, \"but I do not know;","Output":"they _tell_ me she is well.  I dare say my daughter will be here presently,"}
{"Input":"the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by","Output":"distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole"}
{"Input":"really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.","Output":"She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself"}
{"Input":"return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than","Output":"having his hair cut.  There was certainly no harm in his travelling"}
{"Input":"that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.","Output":"At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,"}
{"Input":"When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering","Output":"about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon"}
{"Input":"slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations","Output":"of every part as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and,"}
{"Input":"\"They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\"","Output":"\"Oh!\""}
{"Input":"stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's","Output":"post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the"}
{"Input":"what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect","Output":"for me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners"}

{"Input":"have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation","Output":"with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.","Output":"I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\""}
{"Input":"When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.","Output":"He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,"}
{"Input":"yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of","Output":"Mrs. Elton's meditated activity."}
{"Input":"your doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought","Output":"of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\""}
{"Input":"I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took","Output":"no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;"}
{"Input":"to hear such a good account.  Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--","Output":"Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will"}
{"Input":"secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,","Output":"and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it."}
{"Input":"determined to continue the acquaintance.","Output":"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's"}
{"Input":"a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do","Output":"take place!\""}
{"Input":"or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties","Output":"of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish.\""}
{"Input":"\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made","Output":"yourself too clear.  Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond"}
{"Input":"so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--","Output":"so much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the"}
{"Input":"you joy in person.\"","Output":"He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak"}
{"Input":"own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her","Output":"own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,"}
{"Input":"\"To be sure we do,\" cried his father; \"Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--","Output":"I saw Miss Bates at the window.  True, true, you are acquainted"}
{"Input":"you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept","Output":"at all hazards.  This was the fact.  My right to place myself"}
{"Input":"to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell","Output":"were very particular about their daughter's not walking out"}
{"Input":"and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space","Output":"which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient"}
{"Input":"and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before","Output":"of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had"}
{"Input":"and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,","Output":"was all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he"}
{"Input":"My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.  She says I fidget","Output":"her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say"}
{"Input":"be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,","Output":"which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to"}
{"Input":"her that all this might soon be over.","Output":"The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss"}
{"Input":"coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,","Output":"she was then conveyed to Hartfield."}
{"Input":"cheerfully employed,\" cried Emma.  \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton","Output":"is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much"}
{"Input":"be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only","Output":"looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits."}
{"Input":"ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!","Output":"You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up."}
{"Input":"of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,","Output":"if possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something"}
{"Input":"treated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became","Output":"acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,"}
{"Input":"deal of pleasure and parade.  Her introductions and recommendations","Output":"must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of."}
{"Input":"\"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day","Output":"she wanted something from Kingston.\""}
{"Input":"state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you","Output":"will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy."}
{"Input":"she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold","Output":"and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will"}
{"Input":"and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.","Output":"With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered."}
{"Input":"without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury","Output":"accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--"}
{"Input":"and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;","Output":"of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness"}
{"Input":"\"Ah!--well--to be sure.  Yes, I see what she means, (turning to","Output":"Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.  I must make"}
{"Input":"\"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\" said he; \"but she is a","Output":"pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of"}
{"Input":"valued very much.\"","Output":"She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_"}
{"Input":"after a time.  But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every","Output":"now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way"}
{"Input":"when I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.","Output":"Such a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery"}
{"Input":"curiosity to know where she would be buried.  Goldsmith tells us,","Output":"that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do"}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.  A very few to-morrows","Output":"stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness."}
{"Input":"Just colour enough for beauty.\"","Output":"\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do not"}
{"Input":"She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,","Output":"while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,"}
{"Input":"good society.  I must have given you up.\"","Output":"\"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed"}
{"Input":"Look at the tree.\"","Output":"\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\""}
{"Input":"by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.","Output":"\"How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.  So obliged"}
{"Input":"The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight","Output":"of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity"}
{"Input":"but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting","Output":"to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,"}
{"Input":"specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston","Output":"some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\""}
{"Input":"Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived.  Though she did not","Output":"feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before,"}
{"Input":"very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.","Output":"She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was"}
{"Input":"It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her","Output":"honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,"}
{"Input":"reception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently","Output":"recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view"}
{"Input":"before dinner, and every thing was safe.","Output":"No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma."}
{"Input":"of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his","Output":"horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--"}
{"Input":"\"Very.\"","Output":"\"I rather wonder that it was never made before.\""}
{"Input":"that people should like her so much.  The idea of Mr. Elton was","Output":"certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted"}
{"Input":"irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness,","Output":"and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--"}
{"Input":"\"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\"","Output":"\"No--It will not be worth while.  If I come, I shall be cross.\""}
{"Input":"_your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted","Output":"another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for"}
{"Input":"my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never","Output":"parted with it again from that moment.\""}
{"Input":"did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;","Output":"and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I"}
{"Input":"I suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could","Output":"be led to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered"}
{"Input":"be protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,","Output":"and make her appearance."}
{"Input":"minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion","Output":"deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other"}
{"Input":"To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be","Output":"of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real"}

{"Input":"him about myself of some consequence.  And, my dear, whenever he comes,","Output":"you had better let him look at little Bella's throat.\""}
{"Input":"his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--\"","Output":"\"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.\""}
{"Input":"that the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to","Output":"nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?\""}
{"Input":"a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.","Output":"Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,"}
{"Input":"\"I am here on no business of my own,\" said Emma; \"I am only waiting","Output":"for my friend.  She will probably have soon done, and then we"}
{"Input":"Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful","Output":"that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well"}
{"Input":"from Mrs. Weston, instantly.  As to his going, it was inevitable.","Output":"He must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real"}
{"Input":"\"If I did not know her to be happy now,\" said Emma, seriously,","Output":"\"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous"}
{"Input":"praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.","Output":"\"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\""}
{"Input":"just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.","Output":"Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?\""}
{"Input":"even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must","Output":"and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before"}
{"Input":"talk of it.  That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.","Output":"Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing."}
{"Input":"Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the","Output":"least backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man."}
{"Input":"imaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--","Output":"She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\" eagerly rejoined","Output":"Mrs. Elton.  \"We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\"--"}
{"Input":"make this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.","Output":"I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,"}
{"Input":"nor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the","Output":"Martins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then."}
{"Input":"here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another","Output":"man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said"}
{"Input":"But that would not do.  Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,","Output":"and she must return it by him."}

{"Input":"are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,","Output":"patience, self-controul; but it wants openness.  She is reserved,"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,","Output":"\"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will"}
{"Input":"afterwards said, in a lively tone,","Output":"\"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever"}

{"Input":"But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.","Output":"Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.\""}
{"Input":"How has Wright done my hair?\"--with many other relative questions,","Output":"all answered with patient politeness.  Mrs. Elton then said,"}
{"Input":"\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped","Output":"it was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could"}
{"Input":"It would be such a delight to have her picture!\"","Output":"\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a delight!"}
{"Input":"great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:","Output":"but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,"}
{"Input":"as well as any body.  Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will","Output":"act rationally.  He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you"}
{"Input":"not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_.  Jane Fairfax's perception","Output":"seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal"}

{"Input":"and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,","Output":"they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being"}

{"Input":"\"I doubt its being very clever myself,\" said Mr. Weston.","Output":"\"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters"}
{"Input":"She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,","Output":"and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his."}

{"Input":"if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether","Output":"they would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them."}
{"Input":"\"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,","Output":"the Eltons,\" was his next observation.--\"His feelings are natural.--"}

{"Input":"I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,","Output":"who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--"}

{"Input":"In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;","Output":"and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley"}
{"Input":"conscious of a little attachment on her side.  One might guess","Output":"twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure"}
{"Input":"\"What is this?--What is this?\" cried Mr. Weston, \"about Perry","Output":"and a carriage?  Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?"}

{"Input":"Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.","Output":"But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely"}
{"Input":"happiness of her father.  Emma's answer was ready at the first word.","Output":"\"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible"}

{"Input":"Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.","Output":"The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps"}
{"Input":"Such a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery","Output":"to perfect happiness!\""}
{"Input":"Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--","Output":"at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may"}

{"Input":"\"I am quite easy on that head,\" replied Mrs. Weston.  \"I am","Output":"very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,"}

{"Input":"Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,","Output":"were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,"}
{"Input":"but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;","Output":"and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not"}
{"Input":"the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator.","Output":"Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her."}
{"Input":"known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.","Output":"Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came"}
{"Input":"Name your day, and I will come.  You will allow me to bring","Output":"Jane Fairfax?\""}
{"Input":"felt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.","Output":"Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;"}
{"Input":"in advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it;","Output":"and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better."}

{"Input":"to smile, began--","Output":"\"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather"}
{"Input":"convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants","Output":"had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,"}

{"Input":"we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.","Output":"We must bring her forward.  Such talent as hers must not be suffered"}
{"Input":"They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage","Output":"pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into"}

{"Input":"might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.","Output":"Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle."}
{"Input":"Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she","Output":"could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by"}
{"Input":"Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,","Output":"and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it"}

{"Input":"at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,","Output":"and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;"}
{"Input":"Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck","Output":"her forcibly."}
{"Input":"and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,","Output":"consequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very"}

{"Input":"Emma was extremely confused.  She could not endure to give him the","Output":"true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,"}
{"Input":"by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case,","Output":"he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly."}
{"Input":"They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing","Output":"beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--"}
{"Input":"The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.","Output":"She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen"}
{"Input":"almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must","Output":"be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young"}
{"Input":"I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.","Output":"I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by"}

{"Input":"Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little","Output":"self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure"}

{"Input":"Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.","Output":"He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;"}
{"Input":"they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her","Output":"intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,"}
{"Input":"are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright","Output":"_accepted_ him.  I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--"}
{"Input":"\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted","Output":"the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;"}
{"Input":"It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,","Output":"and she must doubly feel the omission.  Had she been a person"}
{"Input":"Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,","Output":"from his wife."}
{"Input":"such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved","Output":"his life.  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,"}
{"Input":"was deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,","Output":"which could not be got over.  They separated too much into parties."}
{"Input":"The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,","Output":"such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,"}
{"Input":"at times ever since August.\"","Output":"\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been"}
{"Input":"with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,","Output":"a lady known at Maple Grove.  Delightful, charming, superior,"}
{"Input":"Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--","Output":"there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;"}
{"Input":"One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--","Output":"the ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before, but it had"}
{"Input":"till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse","Output":"their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there"}
{"Input":"\"That may be done without horses.  Come, and eat my strawberries.","Output":"They are ripening fast.\""}
{"Input":"cool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"","Output":"\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read"}
{"Input":"I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial","Output":"as I knew had been given her in the morning.\""}
{"Input":"and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best","Output":"judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation"}
{"Input":"conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far","Output":"as she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably"}
{"Input":"compassion does not stand my friend--\"","Output":"\"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\" cried Emma warmly,"}
{"Input":"cold for her.  The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.","Output":"She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever"}
{"Input":"This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.","Output":"The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure","Output":"in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations."}
{"Input":"and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt","Output":"that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--"}
{"Input":"every thing into sad uncertainty.  It might be weeks, it might be","Output":"only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations"}
{"Input":"give any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.","Output":"You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had"}
{"Input":"Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,","Output":"which shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going"}
{"Input":"If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,","Output":"for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \"Oh!  I should"}
{"Input":"But do not imagine that I want to influence you.\"","Output":"\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you"}
{"Input":"and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's","Output":"knight-errantry on the subject.--"}
{"Input":"which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,","Output":"was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this."}
{"Input":"to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,","Output":"and spare no arguments to induce him to come."}
{"Input":"dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,","Output":"we might always think alike.\""}
{"Input":"Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little","Output":"occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am"}
{"Input":"not they go on as they had done?","Output":"Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,"}
{"Input":"hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,","Output":"and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she"}
{"Input":"sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will","Output":"excuse her.  You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--"}
{"Input":"\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.  \"I was just","Output":"going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive"}
{"Input":"will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take","Output":"Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun"}
{"Input":"a great many people talking at once.  You will not like the noise.\"","Output":"\"But, my dear sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"if Emma comes away early,"}
{"Input":"\"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--","Output":"The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--"}
{"Input":"some way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour","Output":"or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,"}
{"Input":"\"It is one that I shall never change, however.\"","Output":"After another short hesitation, \"I hope it does not proceed from--"}
{"Input":"This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,","Output":"my dear.\""}
{"Input":"by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.","Output":"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater"}
{"Input":"I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.  She would","Output":"catch a dreadful cold.  So would poor little Harriet."}
{"Input":"particularly opportune.  Something occurred while they were","Output":"at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was"}
{"Input":"was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body","Output":"to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,"}
{"Input":"in the sight or the recollection of him.","Output":"Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad"}
{"Input":"like therefore.  Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.","Output":"Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion."}
{"Input":"they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been","Output":"admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--"}
{"Input":"quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed,","Output":"had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls."}
{"Input":"and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,","Output":"had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits"}
{"Input":"But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,","Output":"never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself."}
{"Input":"But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the","Output":"pattern gown home any day.  But I shall want the ribbon directly--"}
{"Input":"convinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could","Output":"not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state"}
{"Input":"the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,","Output":"that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,"}
{"Input":"their little whims.\"","Output":"With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit"}
{"Input":"had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,","Output":"and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\""}
{"Input":"here month after month, under privations of every sort!  And now","Output":"to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury"}
{"Input":"\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh.","Output":"A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,"}
{"Input":"A most deplorable want of complexion.\"","Output":"Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss"}
{"Input":"\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess","Output":"that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss"}
{"Input":"for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been","Output":"only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she"}
{"Input":"the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body","Output":"looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,"}
{"Input":"to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--","Output":"impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her."}
{"Input":"of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions","Output":"who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.\""}
{"Input":"who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,","Output":"the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body"}
{"Input":"\"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.","Output":"Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid"}
{"Input":"must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;","Output":"and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.  If they"}
{"Input":"\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should","Output":"not feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable"}
{"Input":"it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,","Output":"and had taken the liberty of opening it."}
{"Input":"don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive","Output":"to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--"}
{"Input":"The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,","Output":"if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed"}
{"Input":"\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.","Output":"\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,"}
{"Input":"with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether","Output":"to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state"}
{"Input":"almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for","Output":"their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after"}
{"Input":"She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient","Output":"moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.  \"He had"}
{"Input":"I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.  I shall leave","Output":"off while I am well.\""}
{"Input":"The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,","Output":"there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not"}
{"Input":"and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,","Output":"formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their"}

{"Input":"good match.'\"","Output":"\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say"}
{"Input":"Emma was convinced that it had been so.","Output":"\"And you must be off this very morning?\""}
{"Input":"and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--","Output":"with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady"}
{"Input":"but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring","Output":"about the country in summer.  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me."}
{"Input":"and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back","Output":"to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy."}
{"Input":"home for Hartfield!  And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear","Output":"with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--"}
{"Input":"as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the","Output":"highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist"}
{"Input":"but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,","Output":"and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die"}
{"Input":"thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--","Output":"She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very"}
{"Input":"Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,","Output":"and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,"}
{"Input":"but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no","Output":"farther explanation."}
{"Input":"chose another subject.","Output":"\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them"}
{"Input":"received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse","Output":"was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window."}
{"Input":"by the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,","Output":"or any thing about it.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done"}
{"Input":"years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse","Output":"her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses"}
{"Input":"sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he","Output":"joyously exclaimed--"}
{"Input":"as he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing","Output":"to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.--"}
{"Input":"to her as Harriet's friend.","Output":"To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on"}
{"Input":"all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,","Output":"he would have been more cautiously gallant."}
{"Input":"so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's","Output":"omitting to do any thing I wished.\""}
{"Input":"be parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,","Output":"or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\""}
{"Input":"a few days afterwards.  Harriet had not been at home; but a note had","Output":"been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;"}
{"Input":"and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.","Output":"Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily"}
{"Input":"as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax","Output":"to partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of thing.  It is"}
{"Input":"\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome","Output":"all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that"}
{"Input":"\"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.","Output":"Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,"}
{"Input":"There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had","Output":"been lately shedding?  To be in company, nicely dressed herself"}
{"Input":"\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse","Output":"had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,"}
{"Input":"she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;","Output":"and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she"}
{"Input":"I want her to lie down upon the bed.  `My dear,' said I, `I shall","Output":"say you are laid down upon the bed:'  but, however, she is not;"}
{"Input":"assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there","Output":"being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,"}
{"Input":"CHAPTER XVII","Output":"Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield."}
{"Input":"He is to be in town next week, if not sooner.  We have notice of it","Output":"in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,"}
{"Input":"\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account","Output":"for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak"}
{"Input":"did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and","Output":"peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss"}
{"Input":"\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\"","Output":"\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I"}
{"Input":"I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a","Output":"friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley'"}
{"Input":"Emma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they","Output":"did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss"}
{"Input":"remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.","Output":"Jane speaks so distinct!  However, she will not find her grandmama"}
{"Input":"whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose","Output":"engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished"}
{"Input":"to a fault, bore with them much better.\"","Output":"While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;"}
{"Input":"With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,","Output":"and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,"}
{"Input":"And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!","Output":"I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for"}
{"Input":"\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another","Output":"pretty kind of young person.  You will like Harriet.  Emma could"}
{"Input":"have been under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding","Output":"you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer."}
{"Input":"as I do for you!--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\"","Output":"Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look"}
{"Input":"residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done","Output":"full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters."}
{"Input":"were necessary to make it acceptable.","Output":"\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--"}
{"Input":"her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.","Output":"\"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\" he continued--"}
{"Input":"Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more","Output":"indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.  She did not always"}
{"Input":"and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,","Output":"    My first doth affliction denote,"}
{"Input":"\"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about.","Output":"\"We thought you were to bring them.\""}
{"Input":"It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.","Output":"It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,"}
{"Input":"`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,","Output":"many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's"}
{"Input":"\"I was going to observe, sir,\" said Frank Churchill,","Output":"\"that one of the great recommendations of this change would"}
{"Input":"she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the","Output":"reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind"}
{"Input":"that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong","Output":"as ever."}
{"Input":"\"Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_","Output":"confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!"}
{"Input":"\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--","Output":"Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course"}
{"Input":"in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the","Output":"barouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,"}
{"Input":"put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been","Output":"carrying on so long.\""}
{"Input":"in that quarter was at hand.  As Frank Churchill's arrival had","Output":"succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,"}
{"Input":"\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling","Output":"in a very frightful way!\""}
{"Input":"and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable","Output":"persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,"}
{"Input":"Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,","Output":"if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely"}
{"Input":"music she principally played.","Output":"Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man.  He had gone away rejected"}
{"Input":"\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him","Output":"conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only"}

{"Input":"interesting subject, and a warmer manner.  In that very room","Output":"she had been measured last September, with her two friends."}
{"Input":"could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits","Output":"affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband,"}
{"Input":"she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'\"","Output":"\"For shame, Emma!  Do not mimic her.  You divert me against"}
{"Input":"half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she","Output":"would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,"}
{"Input":"Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.","Output":"The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice"}
{"Input":"of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding","Output":"who should do it for him."}
{"Input":"and Mr. Churchill.\"","Output":"He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.  She would"}
{"Input":"and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so","Output":"eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no"}
{"Input":"and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,","Output":"she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken"}
{"Input":"had smiled on them.  With their wealth, their views increased;","Output":"their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company."}
{"Input":"just as she ought.  Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.","Output":"\"Whatever you say is always right,\" cried Harriet, \"and therefore"}
{"Input":"to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,","Output":"which could not possibly be refused.  And a delightful dance it was"}
{"Input":"should go to Box Hill.  That there was to be such a party had been","Output":"long generally known:  it had even given the idea of another."}
{"Input":"\"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing","Output":"this invitation,\" was Emma's conclusion.  \"She must be under some"}

{"Input":"and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,","Output":"she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness"}
{"Input":"A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,","Output":"and surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting,"}
{"Input":"He agreed to it, but with so quiet a \"Yes,\" as inclined her almost","Output":"to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct"}
{"Input":"Look at her.  Is not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the turn","Output":"of her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--"}
{"Input":"Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the","Output":"over-throw of every thing.  A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill"}
{"Input":"expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,","Output":"promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof"}
{"Input":"\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"","Output":"\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I"}
{"Input":"was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,","Output":"to betray any imperfection which could be concealed."}
{"Input":"grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover","Output":"some way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour"}
{"Input":"manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.","Output":"The strength of the song falls on the second.\""}
{"Input":"I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the","Output":"fruit thoroughly wholesome.  We have apple-dumplings, however,"}
{"Input":"near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,","Output":"be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself."}
{"Input":"without being out in the damp of the evening.  The dews of a summer","Output":"evening are what I would not expose any body to.  However, as they"}
{"Input":"appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their","Output":"families in some way or other.  But a farmer can need none of my help,"}
{"Input":"\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he","Output":"could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\""}
{"Input":"you are attached to them.\"","Output":"\"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call"}
{"Input":"and there was every appearance of its being soon over.  He had seen","Output":"the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing"}

{"Input":"The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.","Output":"\"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\""}
{"Input":"far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering","Output":"state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,"}
{"Input":"passing thoughts.  Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;","Output":"but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her."}
{"Input":"\"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\"","Output":"\"Oh yes; next week.\""}
{"Input":"He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful","Output":"and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,"}
{"Input":"This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,","Output":"whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant"}
{"Input":"enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile","Output":"beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms"}
{"Input":"so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\"","Output":"\"Very.\""}
{"Input":"It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,","Output":"as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had"}

{"Input":"so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.","Output":"Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost"}
{"Input":"That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself","Output":"convinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could"}
{"Input":"have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars","Output":"of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows"}
{"Input":"    Though of his near approach afraid,","Output":"      So fatal to my suit before."}
{"Input":"about _him_.  He is so very superior.  Only think of those sweet","Output":"verses--`To Miss --------.' Dear me, how clever!--Could it really"}
{"Input":"could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,","Output":"so deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,"}
{"Input":"but this is quite between ourselves.  She is very fond of Frank,","Output":"and therefore I would not speak ill of her.  Besides, she is out of"}

{"Input":"aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),","Output":"to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion"}

{"Input":"means to marry him?\"","Output":"\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came"}
{"Input":"could understand.  There was deep consciousness about him,","Output":"and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's."}
{"Input":"an upstart.\"","Output":"\"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite"}

{"Input":"What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,","Output":"and nothing done.  Before this time last year I assure you we had"}

{"Input":"\"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely","Output":"mistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer"}
{"Input":"half so conceited.  Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I","Output":"have done.  As far as good intentions went, we were _both_ right,"}

{"Input":"\"This is coming as you should do,\" said she; \"like a gentleman.--","Output":"I am quite glad to see you.\""}
{"Input":"\"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband.  \"What does","Output":"all that signify?  You will see nothing of it by candlelight."}

{"Input":"woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united;","Output":"the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so,"}
{"Input":"very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not","Output":"possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,"}

{"Input":"be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,","Output":"and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it."}
{"Input":"I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might","Output":"be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\""}
{"Input":"\"There is no denying it,\" he replied.  \"I agree with you exactly.","Output":"A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving"}
{"Input":"but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;","Output":"and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head,"}
{"Input":"and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent","Output":"dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,"}
{"Input":"my dear sir.  Oh!  Mr. Knightley is coming too.  Well, that is","Output":"so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to"}

{"Input":"and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance","Output":"with Harriet.\""}
{"Input":"He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.  She hardly","Output":"knew what to say.  It seemed like the forerunner of something"}
{"Input":"The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel","Output":"that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy."}
{"Input":"a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.","Output":"It was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever"}
{"Input":"more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--","Output":"whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--"}

{"Input":"ventured this apology for Jane.","Output":"\"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,"}

{"Input":"Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners","Output":"to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,"}
{"Input":"He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,","Output":"she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree"}
{"Input":"You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things","Output":"are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;"}
{"Input":"All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form","Output":"the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel"}
{"Input":"think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been","Output":"but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--"}

{"Input":"I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,","Output":"and try to put difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that,"}
{"Input":"\"My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a","Output":"matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,"}

{"Input":"that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,","Output":"to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment.\""}
{"Input":"Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every","Output":"possible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony"}
{"Input":"apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very","Output":"obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing"}
{"Input":"about it.  She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their","Output":"silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present."}

{"Input":"Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.  I can much more","Output":"readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,"}

{"Input":"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many","Output":"weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,"}
{"Input":"even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,","Output":"she feared, would cure her.  Harriet was one of those, who,"}
{"Input":"would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;","Output":"she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all"}
{"Input":"them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond","Output":"of exploring.  We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer,"}

{"Input":"about ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you;","Output":"but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.\""}
{"Input":"\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,","Output":"that he gratefully burst out,"}
{"Input":"with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton","Output":"engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.  She and Mrs. Weston were"}
{"Input":"before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.\"","Output":"\"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax"}

{"Input":"that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,","Output":"living together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple"}
{"Input":"persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,","Output":"to yield only to herself."}

{"Input":"and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,","Output":"natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering"}

{"Input":"all that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best.","Output":"She had previously determined how far she would proceed,"}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,","Output":"which for the last two or three generations had been rising into"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad","Output":"to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,"}
{"Input":"to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort","Output":"of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently"}

{"Input":"her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.","Output":"\"This is coming as you should do,\" said she; \"like a gentleman.--"}
{"Input":"The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  Mr. Weston","Output":"was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,"}

{"Input":"the justest that could be given.","Output":"      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply."}

{"Input":"One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath","Output":"of air can find its way unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely"}
{"Input":"I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;","Output":"but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do."}
{"Input":"\"Will you?\" said he, offering his hand.","Output":"\"Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we"}
{"Input":"She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage;","Output":"and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,"}
{"Input":"At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,","Output":"is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her."}
{"Input":"\"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\"","Output":"said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction"}
{"Input":"to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.","Output":"One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\""}

{"Input":"It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have","Output":"been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in"}
{"Input":"and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands","Output":"the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been"}
{"Input":"There was no immediate appearance.  No; he was talking to Mrs. Cole--","Output":"he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,"}

{"Input":"in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.","Output":"She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;"}

{"Input":"a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell","Output":"of undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It was accepted;"}
{"Input":"which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could","Output":"wish for.  When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,"}
{"Input":"she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.","Output":"The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,"}
{"Input":"Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.","Output":"They were sneering and negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work"}
{"Input":"Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively","Output":"curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little"}
{"Input":"and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--","Output":"indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision."}
{"Input":"him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.","Output":"It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great"}

{"Input":"She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;","Output":"and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject"}
{"Input":"for making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,","Output":"once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--"}
{"Input":"\"Aye, that will be much best,\" said Harriet, quite satisfied,","Output":"\"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.\""}
{"Input":"As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy","Output":"and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,"}
{"Input":"with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to","Output":"rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve"}
{"Input":"\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley;","Output":"\"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,"}
{"Input":"at Donwell for two years.  \"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,","Output":"and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with"}
{"Input":"little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself","Output":"coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve"}
{"Input":"Churchill and Jane.","Output":"He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,"}
{"Input":"Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we","Output":"liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too."}
{"Input":"appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,","Output":"to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers."}
{"Input":"a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be","Output":"Miss Taylor.\""}
{"Input":"acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,","Output":"she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth"}
{"Input":"I know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any","Output":"woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.  And as to conceit,"}
{"Input":"Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.","Output":"You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value"}
{"Input":"were here!  And how tired you must be after your journey!  You must","Output":"go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you"}
{"Input":"least backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man.","Output":"Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were"}
{"Input":"It was most provoking.","Output":"Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he"}
{"Input":"I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.","Output":"As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off"}
{"Input":"that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,","Output":"he had done nothing.  On that article, truth seemed attainable."}
{"Input":"nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.","Output":"These were charming feelings--but not lasting.  Before she had"}
{"Input":"So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard","Output":"in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,"}

{"Input":"of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness","Output":"with admiration as well as wonder.  Mr. Martin looked as if he"}
{"Input":"It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I","Output":"could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised"}
{"Input":"than it deserved.","Output":"There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;"}
{"Input":"in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,","Output":"they are sure to mend the next.\""}
{"Input":"which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself","Output":"in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent."}
{"Input":"after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of","Output":"with compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified."}
{"Input":"I never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open windows!--I am sure,","Output":"neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)"}
{"Input":"She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at","Output":"Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings"}
{"Input":"should do.\"","Output":"\"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\""}
{"Input":"more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper","Output":"made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness"}

{"Input":"Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.","Output":"Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be"}
{"Input":"come to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;","Output":"he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely"}
{"Input":"and as little really easy as could be.","Output":"\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted"}
{"Input":"he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.","Output":"Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every"}
{"Input":"No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.","Output":"The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better"}
{"Input":"I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,","Output":"but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,"}
{"Input":"of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,","Output":"when Mr. Weston went on."}
{"Input":"convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.","Output":"There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment"}
{"Input":"\"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be","Output":"so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.\""}
{"Input":"sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.","Output":"Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,"}
{"Input":"as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive","Output":"of its anxious delicacy.  For the world would not she have seemed"}
{"Input":"to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!\"","Output":"She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening"}
{"Input":"very `aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he","Output":"can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:"}
{"Input":"\"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,","Output":"or to Clifton?\"  \"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too"}
{"Input":"he would go on, and say it all.  Angry as she was, the thought of","Output":"the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak."}
{"Input":"habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--","Output":"and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,"}
{"Input":"Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--","Output":"The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--"}

{"Input":"He must do it all himself.  Yet she could not bear this silence.","Output":"With him it was most unnatural.  She considered--resolved--and, trying"}
{"Input":"wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer","Output":"for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--\""}
{"Input":"from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room","Output":"for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation"}
{"Input":"and I are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on,","Output":"amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often"}
{"Input":"but very audible to every body.","Output":"\"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.  Well, what do"}
{"Input":"it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to","Output":"think about them--and she would not think about them any longer\""}
{"Input":"Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,","Output":"that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea"}
{"Input":"was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being","Output":"quickened again by injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil"}
{"Input":"her niece.","Output":"\"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--"}
{"Input":"thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not","Output":"to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,"}
{"Input":"He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,","Output":"Emma was convinced that it had been so."}
{"Input":"Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,","Output":"as well as Surry.\""}
{"Input":"and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,","Output":"she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings"}

{"Input":"state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.","Output":"He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,"}
{"Input":"I always say there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing","Output":"more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things"}
{"Input":"things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other","Output":"as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort"}
{"Input":"Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.","Output":"\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you."}
{"Input":"which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection","Output":"from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--"}

{"Input":"As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;","Output":"but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\""}
{"Input":"Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them","Output":"full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\"","Output":"said Mr. Knightley dryly, \"writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,"}

{"Input":"at Hartfield.  No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.","Output":"But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the"}

{"Input":"with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,","Output":"and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle"}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,","Output":"which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at"}

{"Input":"to please me.\"","Output":"Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade."}
{"Input":"Understanding and gratification came together.  It might be a very","Output":"indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh"}
{"Input":"many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,","Output":"but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss"}
{"Input":"by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,","Output":"you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates,"}
{"Input":"\"Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife","Output":"to such a man as Mr. Weston.\""}
{"Input":"would be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great","Output":"regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--"}
{"Input":"\"And then, he saved her life.  Did you ever hear of that?--","Output":"A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard."}

{"Input":"      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.","Output":"A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application,"}
{"Input":"and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  Mrs. Weston","Output":"and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention"}

{"Input":"What a disappointment it would be!  I do look forward to it, I own,","Output":"with _very_ great pleasure.\""}
{"Input":"it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.","Output":"Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?\"  No, she had"}
{"Input":"not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look","Output":"would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily,"}
{"Input":"liked it, either now or an hour hence.  He had gone beyond the sweep--","Output":"some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half"}
{"Input":"and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to","Output":"improve as he could."}
{"Input":"the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\"","Output":"\"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?  Oh! yes, perfectly.--"}
{"Input":"like it of all things,\" was not plainer in words than manner.","Output":"Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for"}
{"Input":"has a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell","Output":"in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent"}
{"Input":"being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.","Output":"She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,"}
{"Input":"A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no","Output":"sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,"}
{"Input":"Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--","Output":"But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise."}
{"Input":"\"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax","Output":"is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton."}
{"Input":"excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know","Output":"you will not allow yourself--.\"  Her arm was pressed again,"}
{"Input":"in raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.","Output":"\"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe"}
{"Input":"She will not even listen to your questions.  I see no advantage in","Output":"consulting Miss Bates.\""}
{"Input":"be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever","Output":"she visited her friends.  But we never did.  I hardly know how it"}
{"Input":"and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:  availing himself","Output":"of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already"}
{"Input":"It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,","Output":"English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,"}
{"Input":"new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it","Output":"possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars"}
{"Input":"and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler","Output":"had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having"}
{"Input":"\"Poor Jane Fairfax!\"--thought Emma.--\"You have not deserved this.","Output":"You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a"}
{"Input":"The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--","Output":"and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose","Output":"Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing"}
{"Input":"every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry","Output":"that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,"}
{"Input":"which she particularly wished to listen to.  She heard enough","Output":"to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;"}
{"Input":"for the house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now","Output":"he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,"}
{"Input":"had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually","Output":"getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma"}
{"Input":"sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.","Output":"Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings"}
{"Input":"if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,","Output":"but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . ."}
{"Input":"When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin","Output":"abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew"}

{"Input":"of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being","Output":"universally agreeable.  To you, he will talk of farming; to me,"}
{"Input":"and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.","Output":"She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;"}
{"Input":"Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying,","Output":"there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,"}
{"Input":"what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life.","Output":"I will move a little farther off.\""}
{"Input":"fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,","Output":"provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity"}
{"Input":"nor send for Perry too often.  It was a pity, perhaps, that he","Output":"had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,"}
{"Input":"to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made","Output":"every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together"}
{"Input":"\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet","Output":"means to marry him?\""}
{"Input":"It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.","Output":"Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.  She was good"}

{"Input":"sore throat herself.  Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us.","Output":"Have not I some right to complain?  I am sure of your kind support"}
{"Input":"Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,","Output":"but said only, coolly,"}
{"Input":"to others.  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--","Output":"So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see"}
{"Input":"\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\"","Output":"said Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen"}

{"Input":"\"Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\" added her husband, with a sort of","Output":"sneering consciousness; \"_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain"}
{"Input":"\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.","Output":"\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle's being persuaded"}
{"Input":"yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,","Output":"and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,"}

{"Input":"of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.","Output":"\"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--"}
{"Input":"She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,","Output":"and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some"}
{"Input":"\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle's being persuaded","Output":"to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her."}

{"Input":"mother's spectacles.  So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!","Output":"`Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job"}
{"Input":"with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be","Output":"three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,"}
{"Input":"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were","Output":"at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her"}
{"Input":"of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet","Output":"mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist."}
{"Input":"He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.","Output":"There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe"}

{"Input":"But she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued","Output":"my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have"}
{"Input":"wretched suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper,","Output":"was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;"}
{"Input":"and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss","Output":"Fairfax's handwriting."}
{"Input":"\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose","Output":"Mr. Knightley to mean _you_.  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant"}

{"Input":"the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had","Output":"seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;"}

{"Input":"silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the","Output":"gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,"}
{"Input":"he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible","Output":"cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been"}
{"Input":"with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,","Output":"when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from"}
{"Input":"as possible.  It really was so.  Without scruple--without apology--","Output":"without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,"}

{"Input":"perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.","Output":"She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;"}
{"Input":"one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the","Output":"pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins,"}

{"Input":"He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--","Output":"He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say"}
{"Input":"\"I wish we had a donkey.  The thing would be for us all to come","Output":"on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by."}
{"Input":"quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.  That she was not","Output":"immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;"}
{"Input":"to do such things no more.","Output":"\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being"}

{"Input":"giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,","Output":"engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,"}

{"Input":"How angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--","Output":"thinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of!"}
{"Input":"and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton","Output":"in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,"}
{"Input":"I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she","Output":"gets out at all.  And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton"}
{"Input":"There is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.\"--","Output":"And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he"}
{"Input":"to exist; but still she had declined it!","Output":"\"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing"}
{"Input":"completely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,","Output":"as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;"}
{"Input":"punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection","Output":"of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'  Heavens!  Let me"}

{"Input":"may be said in her situation for even that error!\"","Output":"\"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly.  \"If a woman can ever"}
{"Input":"He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did","Output":"not herself know what to think.  In a moment he went on--"}
{"Input":"bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in","Output":"a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little."}
{"Input":"Perhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;","Output":"I am impatient for a thousand particulars.  Remember how few"}
{"Input":"but the suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma","Output":"acquainted with the whole."}
{"Input":"The first error and the worst lay at her door.  It was foolish,","Output":"it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two"}
{"Input":"either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.","Output":"The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled"}
{"Input":"\"As to that--I do not--\"","Output":"\"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's"}

{"Input":"it is!  Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in","Output":"your thoughts when you are absent.  Emma, you are a great dreamer,"}
{"Input":"and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes","Output":"were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--"}

{"Input":"She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with","Output":"her father--Mr. Weston and his son.  They had been arrived only"}
{"Input":"\"No trouble in the world, ma'am,\" said the obliging Mrs. Ford.","Output":"\"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one."}
{"Input":"It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,","Output":"before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's"}
{"Input":"\"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley.","Output":"\"Here is his answer, if you like to see it.\""}
{"Input":"He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently","Output":"for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,"}
{"Input":"There is no comparison between them.  Miss Campbell always was","Output":"absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\""}
{"Input":"What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the","Output":"accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge"}
{"Input":"\"Me!--not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do","Output":"not want to think ill of him.  I should be as ready to acknowledge"}
{"Input":"soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable","Output":"quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill,"}

{"Input":"You will be adored in Highbury.  You were very popular before you came,","Output":"because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at"}
{"Input":"Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,","Output":"and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they"}
{"Input":"\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"","Output":"\"Very well, I am much obliged to you.  My mother is delightfully well;"}

{"Input":"no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it","Output":"would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,"}
{"Input":"So Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,","Output":"could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their"}

{"Input":"must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.","Output":"So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced"}
{"Input":"old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;","Output":"modern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"should go and stay there again next summer.\"","Output":"\"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox"}
{"Input":"interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\"much less, perhaps,","Output":"than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve"}

{"Input":"the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off","Output":"for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,"}
{"Input":"disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching","Output":"season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the"}

{"Input":"\"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner","Output":"to convince Mr. Knightley.\""}
{"Input":"Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?\"","Output":"\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\""}
{"Input":"\"Not Harriet's equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;","Output":"and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he"}
{"Input":"\"I do not know why you should say so.  He wishes exceedingly to come;","Output":"but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\""}
{"Input":"He caught her.\"","Output":"\"He did.  I was there--one of the party.\""}
{"Input":"\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have","Output":"borne any thing.  He might have doubled his presumption to me--"}
{"Input":"in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,","Output":"and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was,"}
{"Input":"and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be","Output":"forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties"}
{"Input":"\"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some","Output":"quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you"}

{"Input":"has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side","Output":"which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized"}
{"Input":"\"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\" said she;","Output":"\"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be"}
{"Input":"the instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said","Output":"of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,"}
{"Input":"not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very","Output":"moderate also.  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;"}

{"Input":"particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular","Output":"way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed"}
{"Input":"\"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.  It is just what I used","Output":"to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,"}

{"Input":"\"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have","Output":"ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_,"}
{"Input":"Beyond it she would on no account proceed.","Output":"Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge"}

{"Input":"The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;","Output":"and there she had no doubt.  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally"}

{"Input":"that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest","Output":"of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;","Output":"Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every"}

{"Input":"\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.  Yes, indeed, there is every thing","Output":"in the world that can make her happy in it.  Except the Sucklings"}
{"Input":"\"Is not she looking well?\" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.","Output":"\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and"}

{"Input":"\"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.","Output":"One takes up a notion, and runs away with it.  Mr. Dixon, you say,"}
{"Input":"at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares","Output":"of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,"}
{"Input":"Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.","Output":"I have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that"}

{"Input":"in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero","Output":"of this inimitable charade walked in again.  Harriet turned away;"}
{"Input":"\"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\"","Output":"\"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\""}
{"Input":"She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort","Output":"which Emma particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair,"}

{"Input":"Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss","Output":"Woodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,"}
{"Input":"greatest curiosity to visit it.  That he should never have been","Output":"able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously"}

{"Input":"\"I hope,\" said he presently, \"I have not been severe upon poor","Output":"Mrs. Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;"}
{"Input":"An excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose.","Output":"Things must come to a crisis soon now."}
{"Input":"It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone","Output":"wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,"}
{"Input":"\"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\" she replied, starting on this appeal;","Output":"\"is he--is he a tall man?\""}

{"Input":"and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only","Output":"that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling"}
{"Input":"But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a","Output":"separate puzzle.\""}
{"Input":"He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full","Output":"of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist"}
{"Input":"I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.","Output":"Perhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;"}

{"Input":"\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\"","Output":"said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;"}
{"Input":"\"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told","Output":"you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am"}
{"Input":"in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.  It was no more than a wish.","Output":"Beyond it she would on no account proceed."}
{"Input":"so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes","Output":"with her."}
{"Input":"Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.","Output":"You will not regard being tired.  You will be perfectly safe,"}
{"Input":"\"Shall I ring the bell?\"","Output":"\"Yes, do.\""}

{"Input":"\"But every thing of that kind,\" said Emma, \"will soon","Output":"be in so regular a train--\""}

{"Input":"\"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.  Excepting inequality of fortune,","Output":"and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\""}

{"Input":"their being put off.  If they are not put off, he cannot stir.","Output":"But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,"}
{"Input":"liable to all these charges.  His father only called him a coxcomb,","Output":"and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it,"}
{"Input":"fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.","Output":"She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford"}
{"Input":"and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken","Output":"his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no"}

{"Input":"He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.  His dejection","Output":"was most evident.  He sat really lost in thought for the first"}
{"Input":"\"I shall be happier to burn it,\" replied Harriet.  \"It has","Output":"a disagreeable look to me.  I must get rid of every thing.--"}
{"Input":"If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident","Output":"and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,"}
{"Input":"much better than his passion.  A poet in love must be encouraged in","Output":"both capacities, or neither.  Give me the book, I will write it down,"}
{"Input":"This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could","Output":"not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing"}

{"Input":"beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms","Output":"on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;"}
{"Input":"The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better","Output":"than a common meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very"}

{"Input":"A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the","Output":"nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill."}
{"Input":"and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.","Output":"Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she"}

{"Input":"Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,","Output":"and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public"}
{"Input":"so hard.  Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could","Output":"be the young lady.  Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?"}
{"Input":"\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.  You make the best of it--","Output":"but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston added, \"that he could only allow himself time to","Output":"hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few"}

{"Input":"Her influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious","Output":"that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been"}
{"Input":"The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took","Output":"themselves off in a hurry.  The young ladies of Highbury might have"}

{"Input":"\"Has your son been with you, then?\"","Output":"\"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\""}
{"Input":"What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.  Emma was","Output":"gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,"}

{"Input":"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\"","Output":"\"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you"}

{"Input":"In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing","Output":"till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change"}
{"Input":"fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,","Output":"and quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,"}
{"Input":"cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the","Output":"young lady's pride would now be contented;\" and supposed \"she had"}
{"Input":"a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness","Output":"of coming.  I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;"}
{"Input":"The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.","Output":"John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town"}
{"Input":"Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane","Output":"leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street"}
{"Input":"during the rest of his stay at Hartfield.  He was always agreeable","Output":"and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.  But with all"}
{"Input":"engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young","Output":"people set off together without delay for the Crown.  There were"}
{"Input":"and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the","Output":"appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,"}

{"Input":"it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,","Output":"but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter"}

{"Input":"It was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever","Output":"occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;"}
{"Input":"You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.  This was very kind","Output":"of you to be persuaded to come.  I was almost afraid you would be"}
{"Input":"of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.","Output":"Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman"}

{"Input":"She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to","Output":"be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led"}

{"Input":"a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,","Output":"he believed he should not have come at all.  The heat was excessive;"}
{"Input":"But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could","Output":"not help saying,"}
{"Input":"it must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts","Output":"a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,"}
{"Input":"      Which my second is destin'd to feel","Output":"    And my whole is the best antidote"}
{"Input":"she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had","Output":"often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.  He had said"}
{"Input":"it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of","Output":"nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,"}
{"Input":"to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some","Output":"truths not told.  It was her own choice to give the time of their"}
{"Input":"\"He did.  I was there--one of the party.\"","Output":"\"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,"}

{"Input":"and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably","Output":"longer with them than if he had come sooner."}
{"Input":"and the walk he had had for nothing.","Output":"\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found."}
{"Input":"He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,","Output":"to spend his evening at Hartfield.  Emma and Harriet were going"}
{"Input":"would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,","Output":"and it is only a linen-draper.\""}
{"Input":"\"You could not have visited me!\" she cried, looking aghast.","Output":"\"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before."}
{"Input":"whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,","Output":"so delighted even--\""}
{"Input":"to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,","Output":"and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few"}
{"Input":"suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections.","Output":"Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his"}
{"Input":"Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,","Output":"he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;"}
{"Input":"\"Take it,\" said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards","Output":"Harriet--\"it is for you.  Take your own.\""}
{"Input":"other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.","Output":"Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--"}

{"Input":"\"Oh!\" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought","Output":"infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her"}
{"Input":"bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms","Output":"were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,"}
{"Input":"\"So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--","Output":"the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly"}
{"Input":"Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him,","Output":"or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield."}

{"Input":"who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,","Output":"and only regretted that she had not done it.  \"She should always send"}
{"Input":"not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend","Output":"always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--"}
{"Input":"My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was","Output":"very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--"}
{"Input":"us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.","Output":"Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure."}
{"Input":"A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"","Output":"\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is"}
{"Input":"\"Poor child!\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\"","Output":"\"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable"}

{"Input":"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few","Output":"minutes silence, he said,"}
{"Input":"He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,","Output":"and invite her.  James could take the note.  But first of all,"}

{"Input":"as a man was to be pitied for having.  If it were to be shared with","Output":"the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having"}

{"Input":"Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will","Output":"allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother"}

{"Input":"\"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.","Output":"He was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man,"}

{"Input":"for a week.  Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night,","Output":"and could not get away till that very day se'nnight.\""}
{"Input":"which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--","Output":"She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation"}

{"Input":"Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.","Output":"Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her."}
{"Input":"and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family,","Output":"and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother"}

{"Input":"are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,","Output":"but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--"}
{"Input":"She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and","Output":"their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary"}

{"Input":"Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,","Output":"and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,"}

{"Input":"\"Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree","Output":"to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\""}
{"Input":"and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect","Output":"for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,"}
{"Input":"I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.","Output":"Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that"}

{"Input":"it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two","Output":"people together.  It was adventuring too far, assuming too much,"}

{"Input":"dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet","Output":"under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,"}
{"Input":"You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow","Output":"for his disappointment.\""}
{"Input":"but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg","Output":"leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit"}
{"Input":"but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept","Output":"playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me."}

{"Input":"She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,","Output":"all that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best."}
{"Input":"Let us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be","Output":"done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there."}

{"Input":"something happened before tea, but not that.  Mr. Elton was called","Output":"out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak"}
{"Input":"her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say","Output":"the same.  What am I to do?\""}

{"Input":"have very good sense in a common way, like every body else,","Output":"and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,"}
{"Input":"some thoughts of marrying.  He had no idea of me.  He seems perfectly","Output":"unprepared for that.\""}
{"Input":"she desired him to read it.  She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing","Output":"it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,"}
{"Input":"I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home","Output":"and take care of yourself to-night.\""}

{"Input":"\"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\"","Output":"\"No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,"}
{"Input":"and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,","Output":"to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling"}

{"Input":"\"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.  No, my dear","Output":"little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be"}
{"Input":"three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.","Output":"Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.  My dear Jane,"}
{"Input":"with most friendly smiles.","Output":"He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--"}

{"Input":"still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.","Output":"She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick,"}
{"Input":"One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\"","Output":"she said, \"was that of making her _unreasonable_.  The consciousness"}
{"Input":"revived him a little.","Output":"His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.  The horror of"}
{"Input":"quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.","Output":"He did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked"}
{"Input":"if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed","Output":"to like to hear one if he could hear the other.  That, I thought,"}
{"Input":"had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.  The quiet,","Output":"heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight"}
{"Input":"an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual","Output":"endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who"}
{"Input":"and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.","Output":"Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept"}

{"Input":"\"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston.  \"He told me","Output":"at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which"}
{"Input":"in her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication","Output":"before her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--"}
{"Input":"intimate knowledge of their situation.  Nobody, who has not been","Output":"in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties"}
{"Input":"Mr. Frank Churchill did not come.  When the time proposed","Output":"drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival"}
{"Input":"could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a","Output":"dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,"}
{"Input":"There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)","Output":"whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.\""}
{"Input":"thank you for the sight of it.  We admired it so much, that I have","Output":"ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection.  Your friend"}
{"Input":"What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,","Output":"and with manners so _very_ disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour"}
{"Input":"had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton","Output":"chose another subject."}
{"Input":"\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has","Output":"read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of."}
{"Input":"that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,","Output":"giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,"}

{"Input":"a declaration of love.  It seemed too precious an offering for any","Output":"degree of publicity."}
{"Input":"\"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.  I will say that for you.\"","Output":"He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner"}

{"Input":"to be anywhere but at Hartfield.\"","Output":"Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless","Output":"simplicity and warmth.  She was quite one of her worthies--"}
{"Input":"This was too true for contradiction.  Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse","Output":"could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits"}
{"Input":"other he is below it.\"","Output":"\"To be sure.  Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have"}
{"Input":"\"Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:--","Output":"Miss Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well."}
{"Input":"but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James","Output":"should put-to for such a purpose.\""}

{"Input":"too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,","Output":"or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it."}
{"Input":"I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I","Output":"would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard"}

{"Input":"But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's","Output":"habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,"}
{"Input":"both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little","Output":"labour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew"}
{"Input":"admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--","Output":"which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,"}
{"Input":"took her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly","Output":"taken by Frank Churchill.  Her pardon was duly begged at the close"}

{"Input":"She would be such a delightful companion for Emma.\"","Output":"Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,"}
{"Input":"and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you","Output":"out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already."}

{"Input":"and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation","Output":"could be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with"}

{"Input":"as you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!","Output":"I am always glad to see him.  But, however, I found afterwards"}

{"Input":"she continued, `that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection","Output":"fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought"}

{"Input":"enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood","Output":"of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--"}
{"Input":"on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there","Output":"was deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,"}
{"Input":"\"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have","Output":"not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister"}

{"Input":"It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging","Output":"the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it"}
{"Input":"would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.","Output":"Is not it so?\""}
{"Input":"but he made no answer.  He was thinking.  The result of his thoughts","Output":"appeared at last in these words."}
{"Input":"Emma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in her--","Output":"perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen."}
{"Input":"They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;","Output":"but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no"}
{"Input":"His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,","Output":"saying,"}
{"Input":"by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her","Output":"perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask"}
{"Input":"you know, since she was here.  We never were so long without seeing","Output":"her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know"}
{"Input":"down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,","Output":"and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility."}
{"Input":"or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--","Output":"for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,"}

{"Input":"stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any","Output":"happiness in private life.\""}
{"Input":"But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind","Output":"her and watching every touch.  She gave him credit for stationing"}
{"Input":"pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--","Output":"when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel"}
{"Input":"to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree","Output":"of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the","Output":"woman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,"}
{"Input":"an egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled","Output":"by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,"}
{"Input":"\"Aye, very true, my dear,\" cried the latter, though Jane had not","Output":"spoken a word--\"I was just going to say the same thing.  It is time"}
{"Input":"suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,","Output":"in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.  He should have"}
{"Input":"degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley's","Output":"excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize"}
{"Input":"should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,","Output":"and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence."}
{"Input":"familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a","Output":"little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself"}
{"Input":"no answer, added, \"_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,","Output":"whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;"}
{"Input":"Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick.","Output":"\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.","Output":"What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,"}
{"Input":"we need not talk much on the subject.\"","Output":"\"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\" she replied, exerting herself."}
{"Input":"under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made","Output":"him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the"}
{"Input":"She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.","Output":"The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,"}
{"Input":"He is a fortunate man indeed!\"","Output":"\"You speak as if you envied him.\""}
{"Input":"\"What did Mr. Weston tell you?\"--said Emma, still perplexed.","Output":"\"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank"}
{"Input":"\"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father:","Output":"\"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\"  and away he went.  Mr. Weston"}
{"Input":"after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would","Output":"have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation"}
{"Input":"\"Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is","Output":"as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.\""}
{"Input":"Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--","Output":"Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you"}
{"Input":"Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.  They had","Output":"been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,"}
{"Input":"deep enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can","Output":"she do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane"}
{"Input":"In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led","Output":"on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy"}
{"Input":"if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;","Output":"if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid"}
{"Input":"She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,","Output":"slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations"}
{"Input":"\"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you","Output":"thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made"}
{"Input":"declared him now to be?  When had his influence, such influence begun?--","Output":"When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank"}
{"Input":"\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"","Output":"\"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.  I thought him very plain"}
{"Input":"resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,","Output":"as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,"}

{"Input":"be gone.  They will soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for _her_.","Output":"She deserves a better fate.\""}
{"Input":"Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting","Output":"to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion."}
{"Input":"\"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\" said he.  \"Emma, why","Output":"is it that they are your enemies?\""}
{"Input":"need not disturb _us_.\"","Output":"\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet's answer,"}
{"Input":"as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,","Output":"\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they"}
{"Input":"had probably been mortified.  They might all have hoped to rise","Output":"by Harriet's acquaintance:  and besides, what was the value of"}
{"Input":"and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,","Output":"she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any"}
{"Input":"this invitation,\" was Emma's conclusion.  \"She must be under some","Output":"sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself."}
{"Input":"to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,","Output":"and as little really easy as could be."}
{"Input":"They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;","Output":"Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.","Output":"A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you."}
{"Input":"as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion","Output":"of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--"}
{"Input":"\"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an","Output":"intimate knowledge of their situation.  Nobody, who has not been"}

{"Input":"of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.","Output":"Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls"}
{"Input":"It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many","Output":"a gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for"}
{"Input":"It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--","Output":"gone in a moment.  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which"}
{"Input":"were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.  She was ready to tell","Output":"every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain."}

{"Input":"to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody","Output":"when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever"}
{"Input":"or her family; but--\"","Output":"\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he"}

{"Input":"\"Me!\" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  \"Why should you","Output":"caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\""}
{"Input":"\"Upon no account in the world.  It is the very last thing I","Output":"would stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather"}
{"Input":"was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition","Output":"which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to \"What does Weston"}
{"Input":"at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very","Output":"urgent for a favourable answer."}
{"Input":"\"I shall be very glad to look it over,\" said he; \"but it seems long.","Output":"I will take it home with me at night.\""}
{"Input":"and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite","Output":"convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well"}

{"Input":"After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,","Output":"Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,"}

{"Input":"from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,","Output":"it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's."}
{"Input":"to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing","Output":"worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;"}

{"Input":"Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.","Output":"Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,"}

{"Input":"Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start","Output":"at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of."}
{"Input":"for she moves in the first circle.  Wax-candles in the schoolroom!","Output":"You may imagine how desirable!  Of all houses in the kingdom"}
{"Input":"\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--\"What do you mean?--","Output":"Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\""}
{"Input":"They might be more safely held up as a pattern.  There is an openness,","Output":"a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body"}
{"Input":"\"Indeed!\" replied he.  \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most","Output":"extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every"}

{"Input":"so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to","Output":"give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning"}
{"Input":"The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!","Output":"She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could"}

{"Input":"He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \"Had I been offered","Output":"the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few"}

{"Input":"he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think","Output":"very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing"}
{"Input":"however, the child had been perfectly well again.  This was","Output":"her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'","Output":"My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would"}
{"Input":"said Frank Churchill, \"to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--","Output":"if you are going home.\""}

{"Input":"so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,","Output":"than with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased"}
{"Input":"It was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a","Output":"degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,"}
{"Input":"Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize","Output":"must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!"}
{"Input":"He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--","Output":"Emma took the opportunity of whispering,"}
{"Input":"I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.","Output":"Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable;"}
{"Input":"the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,","Output":"I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;"}
{"Input":"\"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good","Output":"to us.  If ever there were people who, without having great wealth"}
{"Input":"I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument","Output":"at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.\""}
{"Input":"and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--","Output":"_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_"}
{"Input":"But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"","Output":"Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;"}
{"Input":"both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested","Output":"in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,"}
{"Input":"he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,","Output":"such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it."}
{"Input":"\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not","Output":"foretell vexation from that quarter.\""}
{"Input":"\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will","Output":"soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable"}
{"Input":"during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I","Output":"have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me"}

{"Input":"Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,","Output":"would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go"}
{"Input":"\"Perhaps it is as well,\" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma","Output":"to her carriage.  \"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid"}
{"Input":"excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience","Output":"and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness"}
{"Input":"I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we","Output":"will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.\""}
{"Input":"she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.","Output":"She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,"}
{"Input":"As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;","Output":"but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised"}
{"Input":"the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter","Output":"was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed"}
{"Input":"with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.","Output":"With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped"}
{"Input":"which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was","Output":"uneasy about her.  He thought she had undertaken more than she"}
{"Input":"But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,","Output":"not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation.  The ladies knew better"}
{"Input":"how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet.  To be sure,","Output":"the charade, with its \"ready wit\"--but then the \"soft eyes\"--"}
{"Input":"and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\"","Output":"but her lips were closed."}
{"Input":"and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.","Output":"She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,"}
{"Input":"should have the satisfaction of knowing it.  I do not want to say","Output":"more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way"}
{"Input":"she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!","Output":"And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,"}

{"Input":"persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,","Output":"or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed."}
{"Input":"slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness","Output":"of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great"}

{"Input":"and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank","Output":"in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,"}
{"Input":"which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather","Output":"feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite"}
{"Input":"nor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.","Output":"No, she had had enough of interference.  There could be no harm"}
{"Input":"in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,","Output":"and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be"}

{"Input":"very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London","Output":"in general, my dear sir.  The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square"}
{"Input":"to get a great many more.  Emma assisted with her invention,","Output":"memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,"}

{"Input":"though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.","Output":"It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had"}
{"Input":"that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just","Output":"now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--"}
{"Input":"from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?  I cannot","Output":"help suspecting him.  I think he is just the person to do it,"}
{"Input":"While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,","Output":"Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her"}
{"Input":"so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement","Output":"of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form."}

{"Input":"she did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;","Output":"and a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote"}
{"Input":"taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,","Output":"not to see Miss Taylor here!\""}
{"Input":"as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!--","Output":"It was most provoking."}
{"Input":"\"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.","Output":"That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,"}
{"Input":"why are you always so right?\"","Output":"\"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.  I would"}

{"Input":"and distress.  Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.","Output":"Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,"}
{"Input":"to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.","Output":"Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she"}
{"Input":"she hurried on--\"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself","Output":"how highly it is.  The extent of your admiration may take you by"}
{"Input":"what she felt for him.  Nothing should separate her from her father.","Output":"She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley."}
{"Input":"Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.","Output":"When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,"}
{"Input":"She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, \"Much the same--","Output":"not better.\""}
{"Input":"and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;","Output":"neither could she feel any right of preference herself--"}
{"Input":"and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution","Output":"confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination"}
{"Input":"which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,","Output":"would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills"}
{"Input":"to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,","Output":"with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--"}
{"Input":"joyfully; \"my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot","Output":"bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress."}
{"Input":"the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--","Output":"in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded"}

{"Input":"He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,","Output":"\"I will give it to her--shall I?\"--and as clearly heard Emma"}
{"Input":"round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed","Output":"into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,"}

{"Input":"And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my","Output":"conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,"}
{"Input":"She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from","Output":"Richmond was to take him back before the following evening."}

{"Input":"they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state","Output":"of the engagement.  Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation"}

{"Input":"Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress","Output":"would be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed."}
{"Input":"for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.\"","Output":"\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\""}
{"Input":"and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with","Output":"such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related"}
{"Input":"and grew uncomfortable.  Her own behaviour had been so very improper!","Output":"She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look."}
{"Input":"but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though","Output":"the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--"}

{"Input":"But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,","Output":"of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:"}
{"Input":"This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,","Output":"and exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me."}

{"Input":"She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine,","Output":"and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense."}
{"Input":"I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.  I am very much afraid","Output":"that it will all end in nothing.  Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been"}

{"Input":"Emma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests","Output":"to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach"}
{"Input":"if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest","Output":"and humble as I used to think him.  Oh! that I had been satisfied with"}
{"Input":"I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;","Output":"though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather"}
{"Input":"and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of","Output":"Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be"}

{"Input":"Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited","Output":"for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as elegant"}

{"Input":"but poor Harriet!\"","Output":"How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he"}
{"Input":"and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right","Output":"feminine happiness."}
{"Input":"and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,","Output":"\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made"}

{"Input":"or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all","Output":"over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,"}
{"Input":"except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.","Output":"I am sure of having their opinions with me.\""}

{"Input":"had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.","Output":"He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed"}
{"Input":"seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.","Output":"\"This present from the Campbells,\" said she--\"this pianoforte"}
{"Input":"Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,","Output":"\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?\""}
{"Input":"It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence","Output":"his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth"}
{"Input":"but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,","Output":"as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you."}
{"Input":"Jane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.","Output":"Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--"}
{"Input":"and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having","Output":"thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men"}
{"Input":"\"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.","Output":"He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it"}
{"Input":"They might chuse to surprize her.\"","Output":"Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the"}

{"Input":"anywhere else.\"","Output":"Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon"}
{"Input":"she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,","Output":"for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,"}
{"Input":"Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have","Output":"been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!"}
{"Input":"\"Not to my feelings.  I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\"","Output":"\"You are comfortable because you are under command.\""}
{"Input":"you first in February.\"","Output":"\"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.  But (lowering her voice)--"}
{"Input":"Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself","Output":"had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,"}
{"Input":"The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.  He came with","Output":"Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially."}
{"Input":"Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?\"","Output":"\"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other"}
{"Input":"and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.","Output":"Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the"}
{"Input":"\"I could not have believed it even of _him_.\"","Output":"Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation"}
{"Input":"\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it;","Output":"but it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?\""}
{"Input":"had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,","Output":"and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--"}

{"Input":"\"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\"","Output":"said Mr. Weston."}
{"Input":"habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;","Output":"but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off"}
{"Input":"\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,","Output":"open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,"}
{"Input":"that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,","Output":"I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,"}
{"Input":"on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,","Output":"and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken"}
{"Input":"Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined","Output":"to hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved."}
{"Input":"he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?\"","Output":"Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined"}
{"Input":"impatient for tidings of us.\"","Output":"\"Jane!\"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--"}
{"Input":"and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side","Output":"of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour"}
{"Input":"Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,","Output":"and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of"}
{"Input":"but not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation,","Output":"Harriet said--"}
{"Input":"talked of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at","Output":"Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of"}
{"Input":"Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;","Output":"Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding;"}
{"Input":"In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.","Output":"I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize."}
{"Input":"and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention","Output":"from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly."}
{"Input":"since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them","Output":"all in high and mighty claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is"}
{"Input":"to hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.","Output":"If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more"}
{"Input":"\"My dear Emma,\" said he, moving from his chair into one close","Output":"by her, \"you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you"}
{"Input":"quite good for nothing.  Shall we walk, Augusta?\"","Output":"\"With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long"}
{"Input":"this morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,","Output":"some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get"}
{"Input":"\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I","Output":"had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave"}
{"Input":"He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on","Output":"that point.  He told her the news.  Was not she like a daughter,"}
{"Input":"and discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it!","Output":"And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!"}
{"Input":"should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs","Output":"in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening"}
{"Input":"\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not","Output":"be parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,"}
{"Input":"of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank","Output":"Churchill and Jane."}
{"Input":"Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within","Output":"the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you."}
{"Input":"It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,","Output":"not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw."}
{"Input":"and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,","Output":"she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late"}
{"Input":"on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful","Output":"effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,"}
{"Input":"as this to my white and silver poplin.  Do you think it will","Output":"look well?\""}
{"Input":"Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors","Output":"walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,"}
{"Input":"by her, \"you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you","Output":"had not a pleasant evening.\""}
{"Input":"One could not leave her out.\"","Output":"Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private."}
{"Input":"but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;","Output":"and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank"}
{"Input":"\"Emma, my dear Emma--\"","Output":"\"Oh!\" she cried with more thorough gaiety, \"if you fancy your"}
{"Input":"Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,","Output":"she hoped never to be betrayed into again."}
{"Input":"\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found.","Output":"Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,"}
{"Input":"as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have","Output":"in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will"}

{"Input":"the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced","Output":"in her hearing."}
{"Input":"and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.","Output":"I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy."}

{"Input":"of hearing Miss Bates talk.  And I need not bring the whole family,","Output":"you know.\""}
{"Input":"myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.","Output":"You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,"}
{"Input":"of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot","Output":"of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,"}
{"Input":"hating change of every kind.  Matrimony, as the origin of change,","Output":"was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled"}
{"Input":"whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,","Output":"all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,"}
{"Input":"you know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"","Output":"\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\""}
{"Input":"We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'","Output":"Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\""}

{"Input":"he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive,","Output":"and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse"}
{"Input":"and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from","Output":"the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more"}
{"Input":"I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not,","Output":"by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.\""}
{"Input":"and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,","Output":"as happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday's coach,"}
{"Input":"to be quite perfect.  _She_ would notice her; she would improve her;","Output":"she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her"}
{"Input":"as she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name","Output":"of Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;"}
{"Input":"supposed they must be so fond of each other.\"  These were her reasons--","Output":"she had no better."}
{"Input":"afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might","Output":"get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;"}
{"Input":"in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very","Output":"proper compliance."}
{"Input":"a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning","Output":"it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.\""}
{"Input":"while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,","Output":"the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit"}
{"Input":"I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as confident","Output":"of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am"}
{"Input":"I have thought only of you.  I protest against having paid the smallest","Output":"attention to any one else.  Every thing that I have said or done,"}
{"Input":"be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such","Output":"a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made."}
{"Input":"\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,","Output":"\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\""}
{"Input":"for the manner in which it was announced.  Resentment could not","Output":"have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father,"}
{"Input":"had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken","Output":"the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,"}
{"Input":"during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;","Output":"she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it."}
{"Input":"probably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley","Output":"looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,"}
{"Input":"The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \"My brother","Output":"Mr. Suckling's seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove."}
{"Input":"quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.","Output":"\"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--"}
{"Input":"\"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.","Output":"The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy."}
{"Input":"I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.\"","Output":"\"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,"}
{"Input":"and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's.","Output":"He was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause,"}
{"Input":"farther explanation.","Output":"Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;"}
{"Input":"is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"","Output":"\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.  Mr. Weston is such"}
{"Input":"you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--","Output":"I am sure it was a consolation to you.\""}
{"Input":"it would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much","Output":"to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing"}
{"Input":"and long observance to break through.  To him who has, it might","Output":"not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence,"}
{"Input":"A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,","Output":"and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her"}
{"Input":"But then Patty came in, and said it was you.  `Oh!' said I,","Output":"`it is Miss Woodhouse:  I am sure you will like to see her.'--"}
{"Input":"with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,","Output":"and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,"}
{"Input":"Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really","Output":"about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment"}
{"Input":"\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was","Output":"quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls."}
{"Input":"my wish in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.--","Output":"I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest"}
{"Input":"had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,","Output":"it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--"}
{"Input":"\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were","Output":"to be anywhere but at Hartfield.\""}
{"Input":"Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance","Output":"in her life.  She was most forcibly struck.  The truth of this"}

{"Input":"\"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:","Output":"a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still"}
{"Input":"\"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\"","Output":"Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a"}

{"Input":"good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.","Output":"But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave"}
{"Input":"no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--","Output":"she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield"}
{"Input":"Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet","Output":"had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have"}

{"Input":"Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned","Output":"from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,"}
{"Input":"and of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope","Output":"with her.  She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been"}

{"Input":"\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot deny","Output":"that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--"}

{"Input":"on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;","Output":"and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,"}

{"Input":"\"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving","Output":"any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown"}
{"Input":"on the spot.  I was desired to say so from both.  It would be the","Output":"greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there."}
{"Input":"a change to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had","Output":"very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most"}
{"Input":"\"You do quite right,\" said she;--\"we will make your apologies","Output":"to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.\""}
{"Input":"With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,","Output":"\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade"}
{"Input":"how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there","Output":"to take care of you.\""}
{"Input":"will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.\"","Output":"\"No--I shall not stir.  I shall sit by you.  You are my best cure.\""}

{"Input":"was _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence","Output":"of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,"}
{"Input":"an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter","Output":"any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause."}
{"Input":"my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.","Output":"But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust."}
{"Input":"Fetch Miss Bates.  We are growing a little too nice.  She is","Output":"a standing lesson of how to be happy.  But fetch them both."}
{"Input":"the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance","Output":"of the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement."}
{"Input":"off his own voice.  This must not be.\"  And touching Miss Bates,","Output":"who at that moment passed near--\"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let"}
{"Input":"till roused by Miss Bates's saying,","Output":"\"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.  What is to become"}
{"Input":"Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.","Output":"Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,"}
{"Input":"I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room","Output":"that we are expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning,"}
{"Input":"face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she","Output":"has a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell"}
{"Input":"to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury;","Output":"and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than"}

{"Input":"a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am","Output":"sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it"}
{"Input":"much surprized if she knew what had happened.  I am sure Miss Nash","Output":"would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,"}

{"Input":"was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells","Output":"from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,"}
{"Input":"must go and sit in the shade.\"","Output":"Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only"}
{"Input":"a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation","Output":"of Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet"}
{"Input":"\"Here is something quite new to me.  Do you know it?--Cramer.--","Output":"And here are a new set of Irish melodies.  That, from such a quarter,"}

{"Input":"must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.","Output":"They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--"}
{"Input":"as they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,","Output":"I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work."}
{"Input":"the better for it.  I must confess it is a recommendation to me.","Output":"I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does"}
{"Input":"as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she","Output":"ought to the stock of their scanty comforts."}
{"Input":"\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination","Output":"for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the"}
{"Input":"Pray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,","Output":"or to inspect anything--\""}
{"Input":"\"Something that would do!\" repeated Mrs. Elton.  \"Aye, _that_ may","Output":"suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature"}
{"Input":"but it is nothing of any consequence.\"","Output":"Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful"}
{"Input":"you knew, I did not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving","Output":"you two bad feelings instead of one.\""}
{"Input":"the invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have","Output":"been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere."}
{"Input":"While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.","Output":"He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,"}
{"Input":"\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,","Output":"if we think differently.\""}
{"Input":"certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted","Output":"again towards the rejected Mr. Martin."}
{"Input":"and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,","Output":"as you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!"}
{"Input":"Harriet said, \"very true,\" and she \"would not think about it;\"","Output":"but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;"}
{"Input":"quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.","Output":"Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--"}
{"Input":"Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the","Output":"school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and"}
{"Input":"underbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is","Output":"a gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,"}
{"Input":"CHAPTER XVIII","Output":"Time passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London"}
{"Input":"and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"","Output":"\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\""}
{"Input":"\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,","Output":"\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get"}
{"Input":"Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those","Output":"sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.  The picture which"}
{"Input":"to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing","Output":"his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;"}
{"Input":"With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;","Output":"others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress"}
{"Input":"for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid","Output":"to his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could"}
{"Input":"was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful","Output":"in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have"}
{"Input":"\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\"","Output":"replied Emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.  If you"}
{"Input":"The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and","Output":"Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings,"}
{"Input":"had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,","Output":"and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples"}
{"Input":"acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady","Output":"residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax."}
{"Input":"Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.","Output":"\"Happy couple!\" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out"}
{"Input":"might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad","Output":"to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having"}
{"Input":"saying a word, just as I told you.  Grandmama was quite well,","Output":"had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,"}
{"Input":"She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.","Output":"That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!"}
{"Input":"Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how","Output":"it has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!--"}
{"Input":"Another song, however, was soon begged for.  \"One more;--they would","Output":"not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for"}
